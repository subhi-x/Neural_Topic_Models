Background
Life sciences research is becoming increasingly integra-
tive, with research areas such as Systems Biology and
Translational Medicine bridging distinct domains to pro-
vide novel insights.
This is likely due the difficulty and cost of cre-
ating and sharing such a corpus.MN and MID annotated the corpus,
analyzed the data, and edited the manuscript.This is due
to the UMLS representation of SNOMED CT having
over 320K distinct CUIs and we allow an unbounded
number of CUIs per mention.We make our corpus freely available.because agreement due to
chance is expected to be extremely small.
To better support ontology reuse and community-
based ontology development, it would also be valuable
to have the authors of the source ontology know of the
reuse of a term in their ontology.Tools are critical to make
more efficient extensible ontology development.4 A general ontology development pipeline using XOD principles.Many VO-specific terms were added to VO by seman-
tically alignment with the upper BFO ontology or middle
level ontologies (e.g., OBI) (XOD 2).Being “eXtensible”, XOD contains four
key principles that are extensible at different levels of
ontology development (Fig.

Tackling the challenges of matching
biomedical ontologies

Abstract
Background: Biomedical ontologies pose several challenges to ontology matching due both to the complexity of
the biomedical domain and to the characteristics of the ontologies themselves.Results: We demonstrate that the linear complexity of the hash-based searching strategy implemented by most
state-of-the-art ontology matching systems is essential for matching large biomedical ontologies efficiently.In this study, we dissect the strategies employed by
matching systems to tackle the challenges of matching biomedical ontologies and gauge the impact of the challenges
themselves on matching performance, using the AgreementMakerLight (AML) system as the platform for this study.The biomedical tracks in the Ontology
Matching Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) have spurred the development of matching systems able to tackle these
challenges, and benchmarked their general performance.

ference in rank compared to the overall rank, mentioning
only those items that deviate by at least 4 positions in the

expressiveness of the GO and of imported ontologies is
almost entirely within the OWL 2 EL profile (the only
exception is a handful of inverse property assertions), so
while some incompleteness in query answering is
possible, we don’t expect it to be common.This allowed easy
manual review and editing by RCV curators at Roche
who used the linked tickets to discuss mapping issues
and record the approval status of all mappings.For this reason, many en-
richment analyses rely on a more limited number of
gene sets, corresponding to grouping under a limited
number of high or intermediate level GO terms

binary tables, as exemplified by Table 1, where rows cor-
respond to objects, columns to attributes, and a cell is
marked with “×” if the object in its row has the attribute
in its column.Specifically, we exploit the
taxonomic, partonomic and disjoint relationships which
are common in biomedical ontologies.

Creation of a small-annotated corpus of gene/protein

The sysVASC project performed a systematic literature
review that involved a PubMed query with the text: “cor-

transcriptomics OR transcriptome OR metabolomics OR
metabolome OR omics)” [Julie Klein 2016, personal
communication, 07 June].
For
its development, we performed the following steps: 1)
we created the schema and main content of GGDonto;
2) organized the GDGDB information, RDFized it, and
integrated it into GGDonto; 3) added information about
other genetic diseases and disorders sharing a similar
etiology; 4) created a classification scheme for the
diseases recorded in GGDonto; and 5) enriched the
content of this ontology by linking it to other biomedical
resources and integrating the information into GGDonto.As the metabolism of glycans is very complicated, for
the development of a knowledge-base of genetic diseases
and disorders caused by defects in this metabolism, it
was necessary to describe these impairments in detail in
the context of metabolic pathways.In the last decade, several disorders of N-linked protein
glycosylation, O-linked protein glycosylation, and glyco-
lipid and glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis have been newly
described, and this process of discovery is just beginning
[11, 13–17].As it is described in the SKOS
Primer, the SKOS mapping properties helped us to indicate
that two concepts from different schemes have comparable
meanings, and to specify these meanings.Inherited
mutations in glyco-related genes can affect the biosynthesis
of glycans as well as their degradation, and this impaired
metabolism can result in severe genetic diseases and
disorders, such as congenital disorders of glycosylation
(CDG) and lysosomal storage diseases (LSD).

Background: Prompted by the frequency of concomitant use of prescription drugs with natural products, and the
lack of knowledge regarding the impact of pharmacokinetic-based natural product-drug interactions (PK-NPDIs), the
United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has established a center of excellence for
PK-NPDI.

In this study, we aimed to develop an ontology-based literature mining system to identify
ADRs from drug labels and to elucidate potential mechanisms of the neuropathy-inducing drugs (NIDs).Our study demonstrates the
feasibility of using ontology-based literature mining,
network analysis, and drug class effect classification to
efficiently identify and study specific drugs and their
associated ADRs.A network of ADR-ADR based on the ADRs reported to have been caused
by NIDs was constructed.Our study demonstrates the important role of the
MedDRA controlled terminology and ontologies (e.g.,

This means a classifier is trained on a set of align-
ments between ontologies in which correct and incor-
rect mappings are identified with the goal of using
the trained classifier to predict whether an assertion
of semantic equivalence between two terms is or is
not true.Our proposal is to address
these limitations through the exploitation of unsuper-
vised learning approaches for ontology matching drawing
on the recent rise of distributed neural representations
(DNRs), in which for example words and sentences are
embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidean space [13–17]
in order to provide a means of capturing lexical and
sentence meaning in an unsupervised manner.Our results provide evidence that the approach produces embeddings that are especially well
tailored to the ontology matching task, demonstrating a novel pathway for the problem.Here we are interested in features of terms,
for instance the number of incoming edges when a term
is represented as the vertex of an ontology graph; or a
terms’s tf-idf value – which is a statistical measure of
the frequency of a term’s use in a corpus [9].Our approach is based on embedding ontological terms in a high-dimensional Euclidean space.

This, compounded with various other
factors including misinformation about vaccines, has pre-
sented a problem in vaccine uptake into the population.Even to this day, Andrew Wakefield is still
propagating the same discredited vaccine claims, and also
has directed a documentary called “Vaxxed:From Cover-
Up to Catastrophe” that received a special screening at the
Cannes Film Festival [9].We aimed to use semantic web and ontological technol-
ogy to represent the domain scope of vaccine misinforma-
tion.Keywords: Vaccine, Misinformation, Ontology, Natural language processing, Semantic web, Semantic similarity,
Microattribution
Background
Since their introduction, vaccines have been an impor-
tant breakthrough that has led to the near-eradication of
many infectious diseases.Overall, the proliferation of vaccine misinfor-
mation is accessible to anyone with a mobile device and
limited time to perform extensive research.
It also supports any OWL ontology through an
external transformation service.One of the most impor-
tant operations supported by the concept map resource is
translate which returns a mapping between a code from
a source value set to a code in a target value set, if such a
mapping exists.Ontoserver addresses the technical complexity
of terminologies by providing out-of-the-box support for
SNOMED CT and LOINC, and also implementing an
OWL to FHIR transformation service.Future work will focus on adding
post-coordination support to the closure operation, which
is currently implemented in Ontoserver but does not
support post-coordination.A terminology server should include a distribution mech-
anism that facilitates keeping clinical terminologies up to
date in a straightforward manner.
