Thus the solution represents a straight, static, black string.Observers in this spacetime who cross the event horizon are not able
to return, but (fortunately for them) find themselves in another asymptotically flat region
of spacetime which is identical to the one they started in.2
Although the three dimensional black strings are most naturally described in terms of
the string metric (the metric appearing in the sigma model), it is also of interest to consider
the rescaled Einstein metric (with the standard Einstein-Hilbert action)*.Although this is sufficient
to establish the existence of exact solutions with these qualitative features, it was not clear
how to construct directly the conformal field theory with these properties.We now consider geodesics in the black string solutions.Figure 2: The global structure for the extreme Reissner–Nordstro¨m solution, |Q| =M .Note that unlike
the case of the two dimensional black hole, the spacetime is nonsingular where the gauge
fixing breaks down.)Since the
metric is spherically symmetric, its global structure can be described by a two dimensional
figure in which each point represents a sphere.The black string with 0 < |Q| < M
Consider the black string solutions (1).Derivation of Black String Solutions
We now describe the conformal field theory construction which yields the black strings.This does not rule out three (or four)
dimensional solutions in which the string metric describes static black strings, since the
low energy field theory does not satisfy the energy condition.We will see that
the Einstein metric also describes a black string in an asymptotically flat spacetime.This
encourages the hope that an exact conformal field theory describing higher dimensional
black holes and black strings will soon be found.In contrast, when 0 < |Q| < M , our black strings are similar to
the Reissner–Nordstro¨m solution which describes charged black holes in general relativity.(Recall that the extremal case with zero
temperature still has a horizon and hence cannot be static.)Figure 3: The global structure for the extreme black string solution, |Q| = M , keeping the region

arbitrary conformally extended algebras.However, the
advantage of the Hamiltonian formalism is that one is automatically provided with
the closed form of the action from the begining, and the momenta are the auxilliary

At this point, we can fill a gap in our determination of the chiral ground ring

SL(4) invariant volume form on the ambient affine space.It remains
to consider the case s < 1 + s?.We note that the product xnym has the quantum numbers of O(n+m)/2,(n?m)/2,
so Ou,n is a multiple of xu+nyu?n if the latter is not zero.Hence we have determined that W+1/2,1/2 acts
on the chiral ground ring as

defines a commutative, associative ring.SL(2, IR)×
SL(2, IR).We will call the ring of the V’s
the ground ring of the theory, and we will call the ring of the chiral O’s the chiral
ground ring.For instance, the first case of a Y +s,n with |n| < s is Y +1,0 = c?X, a discrete
primary field of ghost number 1 and momentum (0, 0).Since the ground ring is naturally associated with the conformal field theory,
any symmetries of the theory must be symmetries of the ground ring.(2.13)
Thus, the J ’s act as derivations of the ring of O’s.The Discrete States
To begin with, we consider the holomorphic part of the current algebra.First, we consider the chiral ground ring.Determination Of The Ground Ring
The ground ring is easily determined.First we consider the
chiral currents.These considerations can be
applied in two different ways: the chiral currents W±s,n act as derivations of the
chiral ground ring, and the quantum currents J and J of (2.7) are derivations of
the full quantum ground ring.Indeed if
J(x) = f(x, y), and J(y) = g(x, y), (2.16)

For the applications we are interested in, we need to introduce the concept of the
quantum double.(4.67)
22
The proof of (4.67) involves inserting a complete set of states between the operators,
representing the matrix elements of O1 and O2 with f1 and f ?2 respectively, and using
analytic properties of form factors [2].For our purposes, more specifically for constructing the universal R-
matrix that characterizes the braiding of fields, it is necessary to introduce the quantum
double of the Yangian D(Y).(4.9)
The comultiplication (4.7) implies
Qa0 |?n, ?n?1, ..., ?1?A highest weight field is defined as a field which cannot be reached by adjoint action
on another field.The energy-momentum tensor and sl(2) current
can be represented this way since they are conserved.It is this feature
that we now generalize to an arbitrary quantum group A .The quantum double is a Hopf algebra structure on the space A?A?.is generated by Qa?1.(4.48)
Now using the general formulas (2.11) one can deduce the commutation relations in
the Yangian double.Indeed the theories with q-deformed affine Kac-Moody
symmetry, which the Yangian invariant theories are a limiting case of, also have zero level
[5].This can be accomplished by following the general construction of the quantum double
discussed in Section 2.However repeated adQa1 action
generates an infinite multiplet of conserved currents, which we analyze in more detail in
the next section.We remark that one does not have the freedom to introduce a level k into the Yangian
double, as in (1.2).The
braiding relations of quantum field multiplets is shown to be given by the universal R-
matrix.A result of this kind was also found for the finite dimensional quantum group
symmetry of conformal field theory by Gomez and Sierra[10].[2] F. A. Smirnov, in Introduction to Quantum Groups and and Integrable Massive Models
of Quantum Field Theory, Nankai Lectures in Mathematical Physics, Mo-Lin Ge and
Bao-Heng Zhao (eds.More recently it has been recognized that the massive integrable quantum field theories
are to a large extent characterized by quantum group symmetries, which can serve to
define the theory non-perturbatively [3][4] [5] .Introduction

extra winding for an angular variable ?.This interpretation was shown to be consistent
with Bose-Einstein as well as Fermi-Dirac quantum statistics, in the bosonic and fermionic
string theories.Region III is shown
to be SU(2)k/U(1) where the doubling accounts for the cut sructure of the parafermionic
amplitudes and fits nicely across the horizon and singularity.The cut structure in parafermions provides an important property shared with non-
critical strings, or Liouville theory and hence an additional relationship [27] between the
black hole solution and non-critical strings.It is responsible for extra gauge sym-
metries of string origin [11].We will find that Euclidean winding is different around the black hole than in the
flat space-time case.This is not the case, since we have already
established that region III is attached to region I at r = 0, by threading a path between

ABSTRACT
It has been shown that given a classical background in string theory which
is independent of d of the space-time coordinates, we can generate other classical
backgrounds by O(d)?It is thus natural to ask whether
there are solvable conformal field theories which correspond to the solution given
in eq.(20).Although the above argument was
given in the context of string field theory, note that the argument is independent
of the detailed form of string field theory, and hence the final result is expected to
hold for fermionic string theories as well.In the language of string field the-
ory, looking for solutions which are independent of d of the coordinates (say Y i,

Any loop on the original lattice can, modulo translations, be identified by a sequence of link
traversals after an arbitrary starting point has been picked on the loop.The particular case of U(1)3 pure gauge theory with a single plaquette action of the
Villain form [4] is exactly dual to a three dimensional spin ferromagnet; the spin degrees
of freedom are integers and for this reason the model is sometimes referred to as the Z-
ferromagnet [5].39
(1977) 55; T. Banks, R. Myerson, J. Kogut, Nucl.Polyakov has conjectured that the three dimensional Ising
model is described in the critical regime by a fermionic free string theory [1,17].If one thinks about the model as a model of real surfaces representing boundary free
membranes in a fluid one may interpret the additional factor of two per connected com-
ponent as arising from the averaging over a degree of freedom internal to the surface.Due to self-avoidance a gas of such bubbles will exercise a pressure
on a surface spanning a Wilson loop, keeping it flat, and pushing the deconfinement tran-
sition present in the Z2 gauge theory dual to the Ising model to much lower temperatures,
possibly all the way down to zero temperature.The single case we
need to make a slightly ad hoc decision for is when surfaces touch at a vertex: for reasons
that will become clear later on we decide not to regard the touching of two otherwise
separated pieces of surface as something that connects them; in other words, when two
surfaces touch at a vertex we view the vertex as split in two, one vertex for each surface
and a very small space open between them.** This case would represent a particular limit of a model studied in ref.On each of the links we have a
U(N) matrix or its hermitian conjugate, depending on the direction we traverse the link.(7)
The original model had two non-gauge U(1) symmetries corresponding to the multipli-
cation by a phase of all the C—R link variables and by another phase of all the C—L
link variables.The Z3 case seems special and indeed its dual would be
a Z3 spin model which, in three dimensions, in the simple cases, will have no continuous
phase transitions.As in any gauge theory, a
possible place to start from when looking for string-like excitations is the strong coupling
expansion of the model regularized by discretizing space to a regular lattice.1
The example of three dimensional abelian gauge theory provides the best understood
mechanism for confinement at weak coupling [1-5] and, therefore, a natural place to look
for an equivalent description in terms of a theory of real strings.These two
situations are different: While the Ising string would describe a system that is known to
be completely described by an ordinary (but strongly interacting) field theory, the U(1)
gauge case probably admits no continuum field theoretical description in the limit where
the scale is set by the string tension (the regularized form of the field theory is more or less
a three dimensional Sine-Gordon model, hence perturbatively non-renormalizable).The additional U(1)’s have to be preserved in order to
ensure that closed reduced loops have vanishing expectations when they correspond to
open original loops.We ended up with a model of random self-avoiding orientable surfaces that is very
similar to the system shown to be equivalent to the Ising model on the f.c.c.

Target-space
dualities are discrete symmetries of compactified string theories, whose existence sug-
gests a breakdown of geometric concepts at the Planck scale.Phys.B341 (1990) 50; J. Preskill, “Quantum
Hair,” Caltech preprint CALT-68-1671, Nobel Symposium 79, June 1990; S.
Coleman, J. Preskill, and F. Wilczek, Mod.In addition to string symmetries altering some consequences of general relativity
at the quantum level, it is also possible that special features of string theory play an
important role at the classical level.A closed string can wrap m times around the circular
dimension.This orbifold seems likely to correspond (at least locally) to
the same conformal field theory as K3.If string theory is the correct approach to
constructing a fully consistent unification of all fundamental forces, then it should
hold the keys to the right answers.The moduli space of a Calabi–Yau compactification factorizes into the manifold
M21 that describes complex-structure deformations times the manifold M11 that
describes Ka¨hler form deformations.Still, from a more general string field
theory point of view, they are not really very different, and so there may be many
more possibilities for quantum hair associated with the massive string spectrum.The first is the existence of holomorphic prepotentials that determine the
Ka¨hler potentials that describe the moduli spaces M21 and M11, associated with
complex structure deformations and Ka¨hler form deformations, respectively.M. Cvetic, A. Font, L. E. Iba´n˜ez, D. Lu¨st, and F. Quevedo, Nucl.There is some evidence that the combina-
tion of gluino condensation and duality symmetry are sufficient to remove all flat
directions from the potential.19 This means that the size of the compact space, which
is one of the moduli, is dynamically determined and all the other parameters that
determine the vacuum configuration are also determined.It turns out that these world-sheet instantons contribute to
the moduli space of Ka¨hler form deformations M11 but not to the moduli space of
complex structure deformationsM21.A. Font, L. E. Iba´n˜ez, D. Lu¨st, and F. Quevedo, Phys.?Bµ?dx
µ ?One might be tempted to speculate that
the two compactifications are equivalent, but that cannot be correct since K3 com-
pactification breaks half of the supersymmetry while toroidal compactification does
not break any.18 By modding out certain symmetries of the torus, it is possible to
form an orbifold for which half the supersymmetry is broken and the moduli space is
still essentially the same.The most famous example of target–space duality is the R?Thus, whereas the moduli Gab and Bab locally parametrize the
coset space O(d, d)/[O(d) × O(d)], points in this space related by O(d, d;Z) trans-
formations correspond to the same conformal field theory and should be identified.The simplest example
is given by closed bosonic strings with one dimension of space taken to form a circle
of radius R. In this case the momentum component of a string corresponding to this
dimension is quantized: p = n/R, n ?It would be
nice if we could honestly assert that supersymmetry (broken at the weak scale) is
an inevitable feature of any quasi-realistic string model and thus a necessity if string
theory is the correct basis of unification.

ABSTRACT: A review is given of work by Abhay Ashtekar and his colleagues

turbative quantum theory of general relativity.In higher dimensions, general relativity can still be expressed in terms of a
Lorentz connection ?abµ and collection of one forms e

?3.1 Open questions in the main program
We have already discussed two important unresolved issues in Ashtekar’s approach to
quantum gravity.Uncontrollable divergences will show that this approach
suffers from the same difficulties of standard quantum field theory methods.In the third I consider the question of
whether there exists yet another set of canonical variables for general relativity (or a
theory containing general relativity) such that the constraints are simplified even further.One
might even argue that standard field theory perturbation techniques should break down
since they are based on the assumption that spacetime looks Minkowskian at arbitrarily
short distances, which is not very plausible in quantum gravity.The second includes a short discussion of other approaches
to quantum gravity using Ashtekar variables.Thus every initial
data set for general relativity is also an initial data set for an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory.INTRODUCTION
I have been asked to review the current status of an approach to quantum gravity
which is being developed by Abhay Ashtekar and his colleagues Carlo Rovelli, Lee Smolin,
and others|1.; A. Ashtekar, Lectures
on Nonperturbative Canonical Gravity, (notes prepared in collaboration with R.S.To motivate Ashtekar’s choice of canonical variables, we begin by considering general
relativity in three dimensions.A. Ashtekar, in Conceptual Problems of Quantum Gravity (op.In conclusion, I would say that I find the general ideas of Ashtekar’s approach to
quantum gravity attractive, and the results obtained so far intriguing.As we have mentioned, Ashtekar’s approach to quantum gravity is similar in spirit to
the functional Schroedinger approach to ordinary field theory.

We begin with the sim-
plest means of quantization, the Wheeler-DeWitt method.This contrasts sharply with reduced phase space ADM

This is an interesting wave function, representing a time-independent toroidal universe with
vanishing spatial volume but with a nonzero expectation value for the modulus m2.Chern-Simons quantum gravity
can therefore be interpreted as the Dirac square root of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation.The canonical variables in the Chern-Simons formulation on the manifold [0, 1] × T 2
are {a, b, ?, µ}.Note that the extra spin
degree of freedom causes no difficulty in interpretation: the wave function ?˜ is the unique
weight 1/2 (chiral) projection of a two-component spinor.Of course, these simple (2+1)-dimensional results will not generalize in any very straight-
forward manner to realistic (3 + 1)-dimensional gravity.The relations (1.9)–(1.11) establish the classical equivalence of the ADM and Chern-
Simons formulations of (2 + 1)-dimensional gravity on M = [0, 1]× T 2.), the time-reversed wave function ?˜(??)The relationship between these quantizations and the Chern-Simons formulation is more
subtle, since the fundamental canonical variables are different.The (2 + 1)-dimensional model
does, however, provide a dramatic illustration of the importance of the choice of canonical
variables in the formulation of quantum gravity, and it once again emphasizes the key role
of the mapping class group in quantization.The connection between Wheeler-DeWitt quantization and reduced phase space ADM
quantization is straightforward.This condition picks out a connected component in the space of holonomy groups, and Mess
[11] has shown that any group lying in this component corresponds to a solution of the field
equations.These include Wheeler-DeWitt quantization [1, 2, 3],
quantization on reduced phase space using Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) variables and the
York time slicing [4, 5], and quantization in terms of Chern-Simons variables and ISO(2,1)
holonomies [6, 7] or the closely related Ashtekar-Rovelli-Smolin loop variables [8].For general topologies, this gauge involves a choice of time T that differs from
the mean extrinsic curvature.The space of such constant curvature metrics is the moduli space M?Conclusion
We have seen that for the simplest nontrivial topology, M = [0, 1] × T 2, Chern-Simons
quantization of (2+ 1)-dimensional gravity can be naturally understood as the Dirac square
root of Wheeler-DeWitt quantization.

field theory with an infinite number of fields.Indeed, the number of degrees of freedom (18) grows as ?(5) are simply analytic in ?.Further, since non-Abelian gauge
theory is asymptotically free, one might hope that this could be obtained
from a perturbative calculation.We wish to expand the high-

with unbroken ZN (confinement), rather than the broken symmetry phase.?1.14 There are corrections of higher order in g2, and also corrections
of higher order in ?2?2.D24, 475 (1981); D25, 2667
(1982).It is remarkable that we have been able to use
perturbation theory to obtain the number of degrees of freedom of an object
which exists only nonperturbatively.It should then be no surprise that
the large-N gauge theory, which is a field theory with moreover an infinite
number of fields, should correspond to a string theory with an unusually large
number of degrees of freedom.(3)
The two-point function vanishes at infinity, so the expectation values of the
order parameters are zero and the ZN symmetry is unbroken.This is used to
study the high temperature partition function of an SU(N) electric
flux tube.Nevertheless, the topological nature of the perturbation expansion makes it
tempting to believe that the large-N theory can be recast as a theory of
noninteracting strings.1 The principal tools that have been used to study this
are the lattice strong coupling expansion and the loop equation.The basic question we wish to ask is the number of degrees of freedom
of a long flux tube at high energies.At sufficiently small ?, m21 becomes negative and the theory makes a transi-
tion to a phase of broken U(1) symmetry.11,7
We are interested in the analytic continuation of the unbroken phase to
small ?.It may be unfamiliar that the number of degrees of freedom can vary
with world-sheet scale, since the world-sheet theory is conformally in-
variant.Here again the large-N flux tube is
indistinguishable from a fundamental string:7 as already noted the spherical

amplitude in a spacetime of large period ?these winding states become tachyonic
(presumably the singly-wound M21 becomes negative first) and the theory
makes a transition to a phase in which the order parameters have expectation
values and the ZN symmetry is broken.As one increases the energy, one would not be surprised to

find that the flux tube has additional degrees of freedom, the Liouville field5

fix the conformal spectrum of the theory.This suggests assuming that the effective string, at least at large distances, is
described by one of these free fermion theories.Allowing topological excitations, corresponding
to winding around the colour flux tube, produces at the quantum level a
universal free fermion string with a boundary phase ?This is
exactly the string picture which was proposed some time ago [17] on purely phe-

which measures the response of the dynamical system to curving of the surface and
also controls the finite size scaling .1
From the foregoing discussion, we see that the effective conformal theory of

the spectrum of the physical states, but also by a specific choice of the boundary
conditions ?2 (8)
Alternatively, in the covariant gauge, the Nambu-Goto action can be written as
the sum of D copies of free bosons with c?matter = cmatter = D and the non-unitary

In this paper we examine the bi-Hamiltonian structure of the generalized KdV-
hierarchies.There are hierarchies that do not admit a bi-Hamiltonian structure, for
example the modified KdV hierarchy (mKdV) (and its generalizations [2,5]) which, as
is well known, is related to the KdV hierarchy by the Miura Map [2,6].The fact that this relation
only holds for the homogeneous gradation is ultimately the reason why the KdV hier-
archies, for which s = shom, admit two Hamiltonian structures, whereas the partially
modified KdV hierarchies only exhibit a single Hamiltonian structure.For the generalized KdV hierarchy, we have proposed two Hamilto-
nian structures.if we define IMs as the functionals that
vanish on Ms ?M, then a Hamiltonian structure is induced on Fs ?= F

restricted [56] [57] [58] .The energy-momentum

In the present context the need to change gradation is simply a consequence of the back-
ground charge in the energy-momentum tensor, which alters the Lorentz spin of conserved
charges.For the SG
theory, one may take the SG field ?The SG soliton fields ?±(x),?±(x) do not form spin-1/2 Uq (sl(2)) multiplets.In other
words, we see that the discrete series of restricted SG models are given in their UV limit by

The tricritical Ising model (c = 7/10) perturbed by its thermal operator is believed to
be described by the seven-particle E7 Toda S-matrix[37].(4.3)
5 We do not treat operators which take a particle into a superposition of particle states.For the moment, we specialize to a theory with only one kind of particle, so that there
is only one S-matrix element S(?).An important check on these results can obtained by studying the limit where the
particle masses go to zero, so the system approaches a conformal field theory.The tricritical three-state Potts model (c = 6/7) perturbed by its thermal operator is
believed to be described by the six-particle E6 Toda S-matrix[38].The S-matrix element for the process a(?1)b(?2)?I), where I is the incidence matrix (?Since there is no pole in the S-matrix (6.2) corresponding to ?(3.12)

for ?a = 1 is given in [15].Here the S-matrix has a number of properties which
simplify matters a great deal: it is completely elastic (momenta are conserved individually
in a collision), the n-body S-matrix factorizes into a product of two-body ones, and one
often can derive or conjecture it exactly[2].(2.14)
Since we have two Ising models, c = 1, and h + h = (1 ?remains (3.10), but we must
modify the free energy.For more details of these models, see [36] or [15].Per-
turbation by the thermal operator leaves the theory integrable, and its exact S-matrix
was conjectured in [29].The species of particles form multiplets under K, and all species of particles in a multiplet
must have the same level density and particle density (this is true even in the unrestricted

Using the usual rules of conformal field theory [11], we
can then establish a one to one correspondence between the states |??Thus the naive guess for the space of second
quantized string field (which should correspond to the wave-function or the state of
the first quantized string theory) would be the whole Hilbert space H, with BRST
invariance being the on-shell condition, and equivalence of physical states differing
by a BRST exact state being a consequence of gauge invariance of the string field
theory.Furthermore, the linearized gauge transformation law implies
that two on-shell states which differ by a BRST exact state are gauge equivalent,
again as expected from first quantized theory.Let us start with a brief review of the formulation of non-polynomial closed
string field theory [1] [2] in the background of a given conformal field theory.This establishes the existence of a solution in string field theory
labelled by infinite number of parameters.(0) we can indeed construct a solution
of the string field theory equations of motion.It can be shown [13] that given the asymptotic
expansion, the solution in string field theory is uniquely determined up to gauge
transformations.N16 S. Mukherji, S. Mukhi and A. Sen, preprint TIFR/TH/91-25 (to appear

particular, we would like to know if it looks like string field theory formulated
7
around a new conformal field theory.First I shall show that any classical
solution of the string field theory corresponds, in some sense, to a generalized con-
formal field theory.The question then would be: can we now identify a specific classical
solution of this string field theory which will represent string theory formulated
around the second conformal field theory?Next I shall show how, given a marginal deformation of the original conformal
field theory around which string field theory is formulated, one can construct a
solution of the string field theory equations of motion representing the new con-
2
formal field theory obtained by this marginal deformation.Under what con-
dition can we add systematic corrections to the solution (21) which gives us a
solution of the complete string field theory equations of motion to all orders in ?i?(7) exists,
and see how this helps us formulate a gauge invariant string field theory.With our present technology of string field theory, it is
not possible to answer which of these possibilities is correct.I shall also show how,
using the techniques of string field theory, one can construct an infinite parameter
solution in the string theory describing c = 1 conformal field theory coupled to
gravity.It remains to be
seen whether every classical solution of string field theory indeed corresponds to a
conformal field theory.)2
+O(y4) (31)
From this we see that there is an immediate problem in generalising the previous
analysis to this case: if the original conformal field theory describes a consistent
background for the formulation of string theory, and hence has central charge 26,
then the new conformal field theory does not.Let us consider formulating string field theory around the background of one
of the conformal field theories, so that the S-matrix elements calculated from this
string field theory agree with those calculated from the first quantized Polyakov
prescription.

topology change, we are left with a basic question: What is the “cosmic glue” that inhibits
the universe from splitting?Although we have been working in the context of the first order form of general rela-

replace the connection ?µ

changing solutions.This shows that there are at least two ways to evolve initial data
on S: one in which the topology does not change and another in which it does.Instead, one must fix a (topology changing) manifold with its collection of good
coordinates first.What I would like to do today is reexamine the question of whether topology change
can occur in classical (four dimensional) general relativity.The difficulty is simply that topology change does not seem to be
allowed in classical general relativity, and we do not yet have a quantum theory of gravity
which is sufficiently developed to permit reliable calculations of the amplitude for topology
to change.Gary T. Horowitz

occur in general relativity.To conclude, we have shown that general relativity in first order form has topol-

bedded in two dimensions, and show that they are given by the structure constants
of the group of area preserving diffeomorphisms.(G) on the SU(2) group manifold.Now, we briefly discuss the case of closed string.8
The basic question of string theory concerns the effective action for all the
string modes.Since the vertex operators are on-shell, the linear terms in the ?-functions
vanish.To set the stage, let us remind how the discrete states appear in the theory.Our preference in this paper will be given to the infinite sequence of
discrete states that appeared in the c = 1 matrix model [1-4], and were found
and interpreted as higher string states in the continuum theory [5].In this case, it is not hard to see that the ?-functions for the discrete states
can be expressed as
?The simplest non-trivial example is provided
by the level one (vector) operator of the open string
?It can be shown that for c = 1 there exists a
non-singular gauge such that the oscillators of the Liouville field are not excited.For closed string theory it must be multiplied by the
antiholomorphic part.We hope that the simple
open string model considered above will suggest the right direction.Note that this
is the symmetry group of the ideal incompressible fluid, which is perhaps related
to the string field theory in our case.is a special case of T (µ) with µ = 0 [14].

Invertibility
and vanishing torsion are assumptions which must be made to reproduce general
relativity from the gauge theory, and we make the same assumptions here.in addition, so the middle metric would not be independent.Finally, when the metric is of definite Weyl weight, there is an Hermitian
transformation, A, which commutes with SU(3) satisfying A?While the Poincare´ group does not generate scale changes, the conformal
group respects this freedom of choosing scale by preserving only relative lengths.But this group was shown by Wheeler [6] to be SU(3), by a
direct construction of the infinitesimal Hermitian generators.?ab
While there is no guarantee that any of these metrics is invertible or torsion-
free, the same is true of the gauge theory of the Poincare´ group.The full symmetry is therefore the standard model, together with the Poincare´
group and a discrete symmetry.We are left with the Poincare´ symmetry
from which we started.Had we chosen va?Nor is it necessary for our standard units to be chosen in the same way
everywhere.Note that it does not commute
with the SU(3) symmetry, but for any change of phase, ?, it is trivial to write
down the new generators of SU(3).When a particular metric is singled out, the SU(4) gauge is partially fixed.This reworking of the group is dependent on the introduction of a metric on
the underlying manifold.The
mass spectrum becomes continuous instead of discrete, in contradiction with
experiment.Thus, we reach the first conclusion: the local spacetime
symmetry which does not claim more than we can know is the conformal group,
not the Poincare´ group.Still more interesting is the possibility of investigating what happens if the
entire SU(4) symmetry is maintained.is that that is
what is done when gauging the Poincare´ group.1 Fixing the metric reduces the SU(4) symmetry to SU(3)× C(1)×K,
where C(1) is a bounded, one-parameter group and K is a discrete group.A second problem arises as soon as we consider the quantization of a

Clearly
some more powerful machinery is needed to continue from here, and to complete our
project of classifying all simple current invariants for an arbitrary center.Our observation
that the total number of invariants is monodromy-independent for (Zp)
k appears to
be true in general as well.[10] B. Gato-Rivera and A.N.Consequently, many coset theories have a
non-trivial center as well.This too appears to be quite hard, and has been
solved completely in only a few cases (some free theories, SU(2) WZWN models at
arbitrary level [1] and related cosets, and some theories with few enough primary fields
to allow explicit computer calculations).For
example SU(9) level 3 (center Z9) has a modular invariant in which the extended
algebra consists of 3 simple currents (including the identity).This may not be as hopeless as
it may seem, since it appears to be true that for a given tensor product all simple
current invariants yield a number of families that is a multiple of some integer, which
is usually larger than 3 [12].Schellekens, Complete Classification of Simple Current
Modular Invariants for (Zp)
k, CERN-TH.6056/91, to appear in Comm.For theories with a center
(Zp)
k this will indeed give the complete classification.This is a rather
surprising result, since the detailed structure of the invariants, as well as, for example,
the number of pure automorphisms do depend on the current-current monodromies in
a complicated way.l=0

(Zp2)
3 :
T = 2 + 2p+ 4p2 + 6p3 + 6p4 + 4p5 + 3p6
It is difficult to see a general pattern emerge from these formulas and the one
for (Zp)
k, but it would not be surprising if these formulas had appeared before in
mathematics, in the context of some other problem.In general, for any RCFT one would hope to
list all matrices M consisting of non-negative entries that commute with the modular
transformation matrices S and T , with M00 = 1 (where “0” denotes the identity).The status of the classification of simple current invariants can be summarized
as follows.Now it turns out to be very interesting to count the total number of simple current
invariants that one obtains for a given center.One would expect the result to depend
not only on the Abelian group structure of the center, but also on the current-current
monodromies, which for a center (Zp)
k are parametrized by a k× k symmetric matrix
with entries defined modulo p. However, even though the terms contributing to the
sum depend on the current-current monodromies, the total does not.A rather trivial example is SU(3) level k. The center is Z3, and the formula
predicts 2 invariants for any k, one of which is the diagonal invariant.Such an invariant will be referred to as a simple current invariant.For a given combination of factors
we are now able to produce a list of all the simple current invariants, which is likely
to be a good approximation to the complete list of MIPF’s of such a theory.For example simple currents yield all the A and D invariants of
SU(2), and only the 3 E-invariants are missing.

[6] J. Preskill, S.P.Apart from the
question of how such symmetries might arise, it is not at all clear that symmetries of
this type would survive gravitational effects such as wormholes.This is analogous to the situation with Peccei-Quinn
symmetries.Discrete gauge
symmetries were introduced into physics by Wegner in the context of lattice theories.[2]
They appear quite frequently in compactifications of string theory, where they are often
relics of higher dimensional general coordinate invariance or spontaneously broken gauge
symmetries.Conclusions
It is sometimes argued that any discrete symmetries which might play a role in low
energy physics will be gauge symmetries.While no theoretical argument convincingly rules out the existance of such symmetries,
like all global symmetries they are viewed with a certain skepticism.In string theory models constructed by
“modding out” a conformal field theory by the action of a discrete symmetry have sectors
twisted under the action of the discrete group.It is straightforward to check that these symmetries all satisfy the linear IR
conditions.In this context it is particularly clear that discrete gauge symmetry coincides
with the ancient mathematical procedure of constructing new spaces by modding out a
manifold by the action of a discrete group.Introduction
Global discrete symmetries have been considered in particle physics in many contexts.If we accept this argument, our considerations make it easy to generalize the linear IR
conditions to discrete R symmetries in supergravity.These constraints arise because of
the possibility that the discrete symmetries may be anomalous.[3] Discrete world sheet gauge symmetries play a role in the construction of
orbifolds.q3a) (2.1)
2 We use terminology appropriate to an abelian discrete group.Anomalies in
discrete symmetries also been discussed by Weinberg and others in the framework of technicolor.It is the dilute instanton gas which violates anomalous discrete
symmetries in weakly coupled theories.INSTANTONS AND DISCRETE GAUGE SYMMETRIES
The linear IR constraints do not suffer from the difficulty that we encountered in the
previous section.We know of no general argument that
insures that discrete gauge symmetries in such models are anomaly free.

Indeed the Lax operator one gets in this case is that of the Zakharov-Shabat

as in the previous section except for the ansatz for Sn (eq.ig one obtains string equations that are nothing but the string equations
associated to the Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) hierarchy, as will be apparent from the next chap-
ter.It is also significant that the complex-ZS hierarchy is the ‘master’ hierar-
chy for sl(2,C), since the ZS, NLS, KdV and mKdV hierarchies can all be obtained by
appropriate reductions.mKdV

We have already noted how the complex-ZS hierarchy is reduced to the ZS and NLS
hierarchies by taking two different ‘real slices’.[24] A. Watterstam, “A solution to the string equation of unitary matrix models”, Phys.The mKdV hierarchy is obtained from both the NLS and ZS hierarchies by setting

function on which the constraints act:?This will lead us to conclude that the model described by the ZS hierarchy includes the
models described by the KdV and mKdV hierarchies.(2.15)
For the ZS hierarchy, the string equation was found in [9]
??In a similarly way, for the anti-hermitian 1-matrix model in the 1-arc sector one gets
the previous two Lax operators with s(x)?1
ZS hierarchy contains both the mKdV and KdV hierarchies, [10], (which can equivalently
be obtained directly from the matrix model by restricting the ansatz made for the double
scaling limit).Using (2.29), (2.24) and
the string equation (2.13), and integrating twice we deduce(
??In addition, we find that the string equations of the NLS hierarchy reduce
to those of the mKdV hierarchy, and the string equations of ZS to those of the KdV and
mKdV hierarchies.2.2 The ZS, NLS, KDV and MKDV Hierarchies as Reductions of the
complex-ZS Hierarchy
In this section we explain how the the various hierarchies that we have introduced can
all be obtained as reductions of the complex-ZS hierarchy.[7] M. Douglas, Strings in less than one dimension and the generalized KdV hierarchies”,
Phys.This constraint is also obtained from I2, the L1 con-
straint in the ZS hierarchy.(2.21)

We now show that the string equation of the ZS hierarchy consistently reduces to the
string equations of the KdV and mKdV hierarchies, respectively, for the reductions we
discussed in §2.2.More interestingly, the reduction to KdV of the t2 = constant, t0 = x, ZS scaling
theory gives rise to the topological point of the KdV hierarchy!

In section 4 we concentrate
on some aspects of non-critical string cosmology and its relation to the d=2 black hole.In appendix A some aspects of the
solutions to our cosmological equations are worked out.We
have considered both critical and non-critical strings, the non-critical strings being the
analog of having a non-vanishing cosmological constant in the Einstein theory.We have also studied non-critical string cosmologies, which seem qualitatively rather
different from the critical string case.Putting the potential E(a) on the right hand
side of our equations will modify Muellers solution.We will now see that our equations resolve this paradox by showing that
they drastically differ from Einstein’s equations in such cases and indeed are consistent
with the idea that winding modes slow down and ultimately stop the expansion.Let us note that Einstein’s theory of gravity leaves us uncomfortable with the above
suggestion that winding modes may prevent expansion.It is
natural to ask how can one introduce ‘thermal’ non-critical matter, in order to have a
richer non-critical string cosmology.These interpretations allow us to develop
an intuitive picture for the nature of the solutions to our equations.23
First we note that P = ?N?1?E/??We will
show that specializing his solution to d=2 one recovers (a region of) the two dimensional
black-hole solution, which has been found to be related (in the leading order approxima-
tion) to a conformal theory [15]3.It has been suggested that, roughly speaking, string theory
necessitates the existence of two kinds of matter fields, “dual” to each other.It is our belief that the most likely area for a confrontation between string theory and
experiments is through extracting cosmological consequences of string theory which may
be measurable today.We
also briefly discuss how string one loop effects might modify the non-critical cosmological
solutions.We shall study their solutions emphasizing departures from Einstein’s gravity theory.Using this
definition we have computed the thermal properties of d = 1 matter (which can be easily
generalized to d < 1 as in [23]).23.= const is consistent with all the
6 It is amusing to note that in this setup the problem of the vanishing cosmological constant
seems to be related to the question of being on or off-criticality in string theory.Our
analysis of non-critical string cosmology provides a reinterpretation of the (universal cover
of the) recently studied two dimensional black hole solution as a conformal realization of
cosmological solutions found previously by Mueller.

We may in principle deform a conformal field theory through any of its
elements, viz.Exhibiting the explicit transformations on the space-time fields is possible
only for those conformal field theories over which we have good computational
control, such as free bosons.Their description as ?-terms is very similar to that given by other
speakers at this conference of the isolated states found in two-dimensional string
theory [2].This is an
interesting problem in its own right, but it also gives us insight into the symmetry
structure of string theory.Deformations of Conformal Field Theories.The only place where a specific property of the free theory
was used was an occasional appeal to conservation of naive dimension, but this was
only a convenience which allowed us to discuss one mass-level at a time, and may
be dispensed with.Introduction
Conformal field theories (with appropriate central charge) are solutions to
the classical equations of motion of string theory [1], so that by studying infinites-
imal deformations which preserve this conformal structure, we are examining the
linearised classical equation of motion about the corresponding solution.These special fields are the
two non-vanishing components of the energy momentum tensor of the field theory,
and so include the Hamiltonian, H,
H = L0 + L0 =
?This
requires that we solve the daunting problems of string field theory before we can ad-
dress the problem of symmetry.Hence it has to
be possible to pull back the inner automorphism generated by h to a symmetry
transformation on the space-time fields.From our definition of a conformal field
theory in section 2, it is clear what we mean by such an isomorphism; there must
exist an isomorphism of the two operator algebras, ?We must preserve V ir × V ir, including the value of the central charge, c,
and the fact that L0?L0 generates translations.)/?2, and so take us off the space-like cycle.We must
understand precisely what the set of generators is for a wider class of conformal
field theories, and we must relax the differential constraints on the parameters of
the transformations, alluded to above (for the higher symmetries, these constraints
exclude the global transformations which encode so much of the physics).either as free parameters or topological degrees of freedom of
string theory.ii) What are the symmetries of string theory?We shall find that there are in fact deformations of the usual
critical bosonic string which do not correspond to physical fields, and so may be
interpreted as free parameters, or, equivalently, as isolated states or topological
degrees of freedom.We also find an additional finite dimensional space of
deformations which may correspond to free parameters of string theory, or alterna-
tively may be interpreted as topological degrees of freedom, perhaps analogous to
the isolated states found in two dimensions.These explicit calculations need to be extended in two ways; we would like to
understand the higher symmetries, and we would like to know how the generators
of symmetry deform, if at all, with the conformal field theory.

Stimulated by a study of perturbed conformal field theory [1,2], there has been some-
thing of a revival of interest in two-dimensional affine Toda field theories, whose study
was begun long ago [3] but is nowhere near complete.Since the field theories under discussion are massive,
and therefore not conformal, this is hardly surprising.wishes to thank the Institute of

responding to the massive affine Toda field theories the vertex operator will need to be
‘delocalised’ and its conformal nature destroyed.The corresponding minimal S-matrix is obtained from

• For P = 2 there are two solutions: K = 6, k = 3 says that the Z6 model is
also supersymmetric, (it belongs indeed also to the superconformal minimal
series for m = 6) while K = 8, k = 2, 6 shows two fields of spin 3/2 for the Z8
model.We proceed by direct generalization of the known Z2 and Z3 cases.Corresponding to this charge
Q there is a conserved current of spin 3/2 that in the UV limit becomes the well
known G(z) current enlarging the conformal symmetry to an N = 1 superconformal
one.Hence the spin of the current ?i, as well as its full conformal dimension, is given by
?i.Thus,
they are the natural candidates of an eventual massive model obtained by suitably
deforming the lowest c SZK model.A last remark is in order about conformal dimensions: we have seen in the
previous section that they are determined up to integers Mk.In particular, when one perturbs by the least relevant operator the model in the
minimal series having the lowest central charge c, one can show that still there is a
conserved current Q in the perturbed model with Q2 = P or Q3 = P .Its action is invariant un-
der transformations by a spin 1/2 charge Q (the so called supercharge) such that
Q2 = P , where P is the (conserved) total momentum.See also appendix
A for a more general result on this point.We believe that this
15
result, surely valid for unitary theories, is in fact absolutely general: there are no
ZK exotic (in the sense of Q
K = P ) superconformal algebras for K > 5.The interest of searching possible SZK algebras is even more general: in ap-
pendix A of [12], Fateev and Zamolodchikov describe the most general ZK symmet-
ric parafermionic algebra, of which the usual ZK parafermions are a particular case.1
These Z2 (Susy) and Z3 (spin 4/3) algebras, that we shall call in the following
SZ2 and SZ3 respectively, show some well known common structure.If conversely the SZK models do not exist, namely because the SZK algebras
are inconsistent for some K, then no UV limit can be defined for a ZK exotic
supersymmetric theory, and, as a reasonable QFT must have an UV limit, we
can conclude that no ZK exotic supersymmetry exists for that K at all, and the
Boltzmann weights of [11] cannot be used as scattering matrices of a QFT.It can happen that such
a QFT does not exist, but also that it exists and its UV limit is quite tricky.di Bologna, Italy
Abstract
We investigate the possibility to construct extended parafermionic con-
formal algebras whose generating current has spin 1 + 1K , generalizing the
superconformal (spin 3/2) and the Fateev Zamolodchikov (spin 4/3) algebras.2 The ZK-superconformal algebras
We begin our investigation by giving the general form of the SZK algebras we are
interested in.Following Polyakov [3] it is conceivable that all scale invariant QFT also
possess conformal invariance.6 Conclusions and implications
The main result of this paper is the impossibility to construct ZK exotic N = 1
superconformal algebras for K > 5.Implications
of this result for existence of exotic supersymmetry in two dimensional field
theory are discussed.

Then just as in string theory, gauge-fixing
the two-dimensional diffeomorphisms generates a Faddeev-Popov determinant (detP †P )1/2,
where P is the first-order differential operator that takes vectors to symmetric traceless tensors.Of course,
if the total central charge is nonzero, an additional Liouville contribution must be included in
the string partition function; but this term also arises in three dimensions, as a consequence
of the local Lorentz anomaly [9].It was noted in 1989
that the string theory integration over moduli space has a natural interpretation in terms of
three-dimensional gravity [4], and it has recently been shown that the Liouville term can be
1
derived from the local Lorentz anomaly in Chern-Simons theory [9].If three-dimensional gravity is to generate the string
ghost system, the mechanism must be more subtle.The gravitational action is diffeomorphism-invariant, and one
might hope that string theory ghosts would arise from gauge-fixing the three-dimensional
diffeomorphism group.and their conjugate momenta,
and has an obvious relevance to string theory.3
But this is precisely the diffeomorphism ghost contribution to the string theory torus partition
function.[18] S. Carlip, “(2+1)-Dimensional Chern-Simons Gravity as a Dirac Square Root,” Davis
preprint UCD-91-16 (1991).There is more to string theory than conformal field theory, of course.It is worth noting that additional
three-dimensional degrees of freedom can be readily introduced into this picture, since Chern-
Simons theory can be viewed as the infinite mass limit of a dynamical topologically massive
gauge theory [2, 3, 4].The problem is essen-
tially the same as that of choosing a time-slicing in ordinary gravity, where it is well known
that wave functions determine the time at which they are defined [14].For our “thickened string” picture, however,
we need Schro¨dinger picture wave functions, which contain explicit information about the
two-dimensional boundaries on which the string-like excitations live.These difficulties are real, and may ultimately defeat the attempt to describe string theory
in terms of three-dimensional topological field theory.Introduction
It has been realized for several years that much of string theory can be explained in
terms of three-dimensional topological field theory.All of the string
theory ingredients — the conformal field theory partition function, the vertex operators, the
Liouville action, the diffeomorphism ghosts, and the integration over moduli space — have
straightforward three-dimensional interpretations.As a topological field theory, Chern-
Simons theory has a trivial propagator, so the transition amplitude on a three-manifold with
the topology [0, 1]×?Gravity and Ghosts
Before proceeding further, we should address a possible misconception about ghosts and
three-dimensional gravity.The physical picture is that of a string “thickened” to an annulus;
since Chern-Simons theory is topological, it is only the string-like edge excitations of the
resulting membrane that contribute to the amplitudes.Conclusion
We have now seen that the entire one-loop partition function in string theory can be
reconstructed from three-dimensional gravity and topological field theory.

Similarly, the vanishing of (3.18) translates into
the requirement that P (s) corresponds to a singular vector in the quantum group Verma
module of highest weight ?(+).It is also clear that, in the language of homology with local coefficients, the vanish-
ing of (3.18) is equivalent to the corresponding contour C being closed.Realizations of the chiral algebra by free fields, resolutions which project onto
its irreducible representations from the Fock space modules, and chiral vertex operators

references therein).As a corollary we derive character formulae

group of the Standard Model and appropriate matter fields as discussed, for example, in

modular invariance establishes a connection between the N = 1 effective supergravity

of automorphic functions: the first one provides a duality invariant completion of K0,
whereas the second one is needed to cancel the duality anomaly coming from log detKRij .This
situation is what we call minimal string unification.If no string model with the characteristics of the above minimal unification scenario is
found, one can think about the following two alternatives with possibly only tiny string
threshold effects: (i) There is unification at the scale MX ?the matter fields transform under PSL(2,Z) as ?Rai ?Namely, we will consider a possible situation in
which (i) the massless particles with standard model gauge couplings are just those of the
minimal supersymmetric Standard Model with gauge group G = SU(3)× SU(2)× U(1);
(ii) there is no partial (field theoretical) unification scheme below the string scale.Consider the one-loop string threshold corrections [3] to the gauge coupling constants
for heterotic string compactifications on six-dimensional Calabi–Yau spaces [4].Until now no realistic string model
with these characteristics has been built, but the model search done up to now has been
extremely limited and by no means complete.The threshold contributions are given in
terms of automorphic functions of the target space duality group.In order to give at least a formal construction of ?, one
uses the fact the moduli space of (2,2) Calabi–Yau compactifications is a special Ka¨hler

This
opens the possibility of investigating the fascinating issues surrounding the problem of
Hawking radiation in the context of a consistent quantum theory of gravity.This is unacceptable: even
if one could stomach a theory with an infinite number of free parameters, it is doubtful
that the resulting theory is stable and unitary at the Planck scale.However, since an arbitrarily large amount of information can fall into the black
hole, a qualitative effect on the question of coherence loss could occur only in a theory with
infinite varieties of quantum hair.This phase is quantum
mechanically detectable through interference experiments.The last problem in this figure, quantum gravity, was noted in the fifties by Pauli.Most notably, the state A˜ = 0 is represented in a singular
fashion.For example, the ultraviolet catastrophe which occurs
in the thermodynamics of classical electromagnetism led to the development of quantum
mechanics.Nevertheless
it provides a rich and fascinating model to study the conceptual revolution in our view of
the universe which will inevitably accompany the unification of quantum mechanics and
general relativity.Further, all the forces and

The last column gives the mirror
manifold M ?As we observed, though, on the mirror manifold of (4.6),
this will be realized as a geometrical symmetry at some point in the moduli space.in (4.6) implies equivalence up to deformations by twisted
fields, but for our purpose of establishing the existence of the mirror manifold, the precise
point in its moduli space is inessential.Because this interchange corresponds to a reflection of the manifold’s Hodge
diamond (which is equivalent to a ninety–degree rotation of the diamond), we gave the
name mirror manifolds [5] to such a pair of Calabi-Yau spaces.In fact, several groups, based on ‘naturality’
arguments, had earlier speculated on the possibility of mirror symmetry.However, these field transformations do not simply provide a new representation for
the mirror construction of [5], as these authors had supposed – rather, we argue that one
does not generate the mirror of the original theory but instead the mirror of a theory at a
different point in the same moduli space as the original.To be concrete, let us recall the simplest example of this mirror manifold construction.2 We recall that when describing string propagation we are naturally led to a complexification
of the Ka¨hler cone when we augment the metric with the background antisymmetric tensor field
B.Quite generally, then, we can
follow this procedure to determine the mirror of any deformation of M10.Recall that the mirror manifold M ?The upshot of this discussion is that we have constructed an explicit mirror pair M˜
and M ??To illustrate these ideas, lets return to the example of the quintic hypersurface and
its mirror (2.4).At the same time the work also affirms another aspect of
mirror symmetry which to this point we have not stressed.Recent Work on Extending Mirror Symmetry
The final topic we would like to mention is some recent work of ours [21] which offers
the possibility of extending the mirror manifold construction reviewed in section 2 to a
more general class of theories.In this paper, Candelas, de La Ossa,
Green and Parkes analyze (3.3) for the case of the quintic–mirror-quintic pair (2.4)11.For ease of computation the authors chose to work with the mirror pair having ?They also chose to work at large radius on the mirror manifold (the ?is not the mirror of the Fermat hypersurface.In

As yet our formulation of the problem has been such that a background gauge
field A¯(t) is given to us.These results are in agreement with the calculation of the scattering amplitude
in two dimensional critical string theory [18] (where the liouville mode acts as a
spatial dimension) with a flat metric and a linear dilaton.21
The generators of the residual gauge transformation in the fermi field theory
are given by
W (r,s) =
?it in the coordinate space formulation corresponds to the analytic
continuation t ?Let us expand the
second quantised fermi field in terms of parabolic cylinder wave-functions and the
corresponding creation-annihilation operators of the single-particle states.The SL(2) structure
has appeared in the discussions of the continuum theory in [22].The operators r, 0 and 0, s corresponds to the
tachyon (energy2 + momentum2=0) but only at integral values of the energy.(Clearly any state can be reached from any other by the operators
Emn hence by the operators W
(r,s)).As is well-known, the fermionic field theory (2.1) can be built entirely from the
knowledge of the single-particle states.We briefly
discuss a scenario for a background independent formulation of the theory.We consider the classical limit of this theory and
make the correspondence with the discrete states of the c = 1 (Euclidean time)
Liouville theory.The existence
of such states in the matrix model has been most clearly indicated by a study of
the two point function of time dependent operators [22].26
Thus we conclude that the entireW -algebra splits into irreps of the SL(2) with
r+ s being the spin j and r?s being the J3-value (remember in (9.5) the operator
xp plays the role of J3 and the other two are the rasing and lowering operators
J±).This however is not in conflict with the fact that
the analytically continued theory meaningfully defines the correlation functions of
external tachyons with continuous momentum.(r+s)?+i(r?s)t (9.11)
It is intriguing to note that this is identical to the exponential part of the r, s
vertex operators in the c = 1 Liouville theory for one of the liouville dressings,
where the time t is taken to be Euclidean.The
elementary low-energy excitation of this model is a particle-hole pair which has
a massless dispersion relation [10,11] and has been identified with the tachyon of
the continuum theory [12,6].0 and for the derivation we take i times the single particle hamiltonian,
ih = i2(p
2?x2) = ?Importantly we are finding here vertex operators with only quantised energies, im-
plying in partiulcar the absence of the tachyon vertex operators with continuously
varying energy and momentum.Besides the massless tachyon the spectrum of the two dimensional critical string
theory (in the above mentioned background) has an infinite tower of discrete states
labelled by two non-negative integers (r, s) [19-21] These states are the gauge in-
variant content of the higher spin states.

the context of string theory, the task of incorporating strongly interacting gauge theory
dynamics becomes even more compelling since many crucial properties of the string theory
may not be discerned until a deeper grasp of the vacuum structure of this kind of gauge
theories is obtained [6].The free-fermionic formulation of string theory [20] is specially suited to explore these
questions, since the nonrenormalizable terms can be explicitly calculated [12] and modular
properties of these terms can also be determined.The effect of the superpotential is felt in determining the
vacuum structure of the theory lifting the degeneracy of the vacuum, and in the specific
value of the gaugino condensate.B 245 (1990) 409; H. P. Nilles

been incorporated.Additionally, many of the

Ultimately we would like to derive an effective string theory directly from QCD.Indeed one of the chief motivations
for this approach is to gain insight into what sort of string behavior is most rel-
evant for hadron physics as a step towards constructing a complete theory.The present work is motivated by the following questions: To what extent can
some string theory serve as an effective theory for QCD within the kinematical
regimes for which string behavior is observed in the data and expected on general
grounds?We also review the difficulties involved in constructing complete effective
string theories for hadrons, and comment on the relation between the intercepts of
trajectories and the short distance behavior of the underlying theory.Moreover there is considerable theoretical prejudice (encouraged by the flux tube
picture, and the area confinement law found in the strong coupling expansion) that
some limit of QCD (perhaps Nc ??)27
knowledge of a string theory than a tree amplitude; problems which we could
largely sidestep at tree level, such as undesirable trajectories or the additional
degrees of freedom required for the cancelation of the conformal anomaly, cannot be
avoided.Admittedly, settling for effective string amplitudes instead of complete string
theories is less than completely satisfactory.Apriori there is much guess work involved in deciding what
constitutes “string behavior” and in deciding how certain physical features should
be incorporated into the string picture; fortunately there exists a wealth of data
from low energy hadronic physics which can be consulted for guidance, along with
the knowledge that the underlying theory is QCD.Finally we come to hadronic states which are easily treatable within the string
framework for some purposes but not for others.Without a complete string theory we have at best only some general guidelines
for determining when an effective string amplitude should be appropriate.Closed strings, the pomeron, and the additive
quark rules for total hadronic cross sections
In any given string model one can analyze the closed string spectrum and
scattering amplitudes as easily as those for open strings.Conclusions
In this work we have advocated the use of effective string amplitudes for hadron
phenomenology.Introduction
Originally string theory was a phenomenological theory of hadronic physics, de-
veloped to describe some striking features of hadrons and their interactions.Or, is it the case that some
corner of a complete string model (e.g., some trajectories, the closed string sector,
some highly excited states, or loop amplitudes) cannot be neatly divorced from the
short distance physics and will necessarily lead to undesirable features even in the
long distance predictions of the model?More specifi-
cally, when does string perturbation theory begin to break down (i.e., loops grow in
importance) and when does the finite thickness of QCD flux tubes become signifi-

ABSTRACT
We propose using the general structure and properties of conformal field the-
ory amplitudes, in particular those defined on surfaces with boundaries, to explore
effective string theory amplitudes for some hadronic processes.These short distance problems are fundamentally connected with the most
serious of the traditional problems plaguing string theories applied to hadronic
physics.If we assume in addition that in some intermediate energy regime
pion amplitudes exhibit string behavior, do any other general predictions follow?); nonetheless, we
expect some features to survive in any realistic hadronic string model.

Going back to our main line, we note that the analysis just recalled may
be carried out not only onM but also on the Grassmannian manifolds whose
construction was recalled in section 3 for CP n. For each k, Eq.25 precisely
means that the action is tological, and that the lower bound S = Q is

Our basic strategy is to study embeddings of two-dimensional surfaces ?A chiral

there is no real distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry.(14)
6Note that these are defined in [2], through canonical Poisson brackets that do not
assume that Toda equations hold.32 may be understood as the index theorem for W-surfaces.First, the extrinsic geometry of abstract Riemann
surfaces was beautifuly discussed[6], using the complex analogue of Frenet’s
formalism, by lifting the curve to Grassmannian manifolds with the Fubini-
Study metric which is a Ka¨hler metric associated with the standard metric
on CP n. Second, one of us has just shown[7] that the free fermion formal-
ism of the KP hierarchy, and its related Grassmannian manifold — which is
directly related to the one just mentionned — has a close connection with
W-algebras, the additional variables of the KP systems, allowing to linearise
the W-transformations.The Ka¨hler condition will play an essential roˆle
in the free-fermion approach, and in sections 3 and 4.Thus they move the surface and the
distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry is not W-invariant.Going to the second derivatives, one deduces from the above that

The Flipped SU(5) String Model
As explained in the previous section, to build a model in the free fermionic formulation
one needs to specify a consistent set of vectors and generalized GSO projections.A major advance in free fermionic string model building came with the eluci-
dation of the techniques to calculate higher-order terms in the superpotential [29].1016GeV (put in by hand), and (iii) the
scale of hidden sector condensation ?10 ?This string model was indeed
close to its field theory analog but had the major advantage that its cubic superpotential
could actually be calculated (as opposed to just being postulated).1014?15GeV, we expect the
SU(4)h bound states to be much lighter than SO(10)h bound states in general.From this information all interactions in the model (e.g., cubic and
higher-order superpotential, D-terms, etc.)Each vector in the model generates a sector of states (which may or may not be projected
out by the chosen GSO projections).B 347 (1990) 625; A. Kagan and S. Samuel, City College
preprints CCNY-HEP-90/17 and CCNY-HEP-91/8.The hidden sector fields transform under
SO(10)h × SU(4)h as follows: T (10, 1), D (1, 6), F˜ (1, 4).Conclusions
We have described the early developments leading up to the flipped SU(5) string
model, focusing on the rationale behind this particular string model and basic model-
bulding in the free fermionic formulation of superstrings, which was used to construct the
flipped SU(5) model.However, it certainly is the most developed string model to date.From the light spectrum
of the model three kinds of SU(4)h × SO(10)h invariant bound states follow:

that most of these fields become superheavy.2

Of course, one may just consider the problem of the universe
creation as an interesting theoretical problem to think about in a spare time,
but if the universe creation is entirely useless, one may find other interesting
problems to solve.There is an additional
exponential suppression of the probability of tunneling in this theory as com-
pared with (15).Thus, we see that the stochastic methods, which proved to be very efficient
in the theory of tunneling, may help us to understand such issues as the baby
universe formation in the vacuum and at a finite temperature.(29)
3One should remember that in a theory of several scalar fields with different coupling
constants the probability of creation of an inflationary universe is given by the largest
coupling constant, whereas the density perturbations ??/?It is not incon-
ceivable that only in this context one can really understand the origin of our
own universe.However, the most
ironical part of it is the question whether the new universe can be useful for
us in any way.Indeed, the stationary solution (23) looks as a square of the Hartle-
Hawking wave function of the ground state of the universe [15] obtained by
Euclidean methods.However, the standard lore of the theory of tunneling with the universe pro-
duction is based on the Euclidean approach to quantum cosmology [11]-[13].148B (1984) 280; A. Vilenkin, Phys.This does not mean, however, that
there is no tunneling in this theory.(30)
This means that the baby universe formation should be very efficient in the
theories in which the heaviest scalar particles have masses comparable with
Mp.Moreover,
it is clear that if the process of the baby universe formation may occur at
all, it should be most efficient at the density close to the Planck density.5 Discussion
It is quite clear that the estimates which were obtained by the stochastic
approach to tunneling cannot serve as a substitute of a complete investigation
by more regular methods; a much more detailed investigation is needed to
prove that the process of the baby universe formation can actually occur
either in the empty Minkowski space or in a laboratory.The probability of the
bubble formation per unit four-volume can be estimated by the expression
P ?It is
quite clear that if the process of the baby universe formation can occur at
all, inflationary domains with V (?)One cannot jump into
the new universe, since at the moment of its creation it is microscopically
small and extremely dense, and later it decouples from our universe.In the inflationary
universe scenario one can do the same job by producing a scalar field ?In order to create a large universe which would be as long-
living as ours, one would need to have at least as many particles as their
total number in the observable part of our universe...Quantum jumps of the scalar field to
the Planck density space-time foam, which regularly occur in this scenario,
and subsequent jumps of the field back from the space-time foam may be in-
terpreted as a process of creation of new inflationary universes which are not
21
attached to our universe by any regions of classical space-time.

and the string field
theory action is given by [3] [4] [14]

transformation law of the gauge field Aµ to ?Aµ = ?µ((1+f(A))?)?2g was worked out in ref.[15].acting on the vacuum [19].It is therefore natural to ask
how to reconcile these apparently different features of string field theory and low
energy effective field theory.and
the dilaton D appearing in the low energy effective field theory transform as,
?Gµ?3, where the quadratic
part of the action obtained from string field theory was shown to agree with that
29
of low energy effective field theory.)In fact, from our analysis, we have already seen that the gauge transfor-
mations of low energy effective field theory indeed correspond to combinations of
gauge transformation and the trivial symmetry in string field theory.We allow for the
most general functional relation between string fields and the low energy fields,
and also between the gauge transformations in string field theory and those in low
energy effective field theory.To this order we also identify specific symmetries of the string
field theory which can be identified as gauge transformations of the low energy
effective field theory.DISCUSSION
In this paper we have studied how off-shell general coordinate transformations
and antisymmetric tensor gauge transformations arise in string field theory.One of the specific results of our analysis is that the off-shell gauge symmetries
of low energy effective field theory cannot be identified to just a combination of off-
shell gauge symmetries alone of string field theory.Work-
ing to first non-linear order, we have shown that it is possible to identify specific
string field configurations with off-shell field configurations in low energy effective
field theory, and specific symmetry transformations in string theory with off-shell
gauge transformations in low energy effective field theory, so that the symmetry
transformations in the former theory are compatible with those in the latter theory.The gauge algebra of string field theory is characterized by two important
features.respectively such that the gauge transformations in string field theory match
those in the low energy effective field theory.2 we explain our general approach
to solve the problem of identifying the field configurations and gauge symmetries
in low energy effective field theory to those in string field theory.This completes the proof that
to first non-linear order, suitable functional relations between the fields and gauge
transformation parameters appearing in string field theory and those appearing
in low energy effective field theory may be found so that gauge invariance in low
energy effective field theory can be derived as a consequence of the symmetries of
string field theory.Closed bosonic string theory at low energies is described by the effective field
theory involving the graviton, the dilaton, and the antisymmetric tensor gauge
fields.If the answer is in the affirmative, then
we could say that we have been able to identify the off-shell gauge transformations
of low energy effective field theory to specific gauge transformations in string field
theory.

that the solutions of the Virasoro conditions, in the unitarity regime of the

SU(1, 1) theory coupled to an arbitrary unitary conformal field theory (UCFT), we
will show that the resulting physical state space will automatically also satisfy the
Euclidean coset condition, when we restrict ourselves to the representations which
have been proved to be unitary for the SU(1, 1) string theory [4].Here Ln|t; h,m?= 0, n > 0, implies that Ln|??= Ln|s?Ln +

of the SU(1, 1) string theory than the one given in ref.[4].Such a coset must exist, since by gauge invariance the dimensionality of the physical

a solution to the Virasoro conditions.

and V describes one field theoretic degree of freedom in the appropriate dimension.The fact that Liouville momentum is not conserved and we have to sum over
all p’s may turn this pole into a cut: (4.16) depends on |k1 + k2|.The projection can then be performed by
constructing the (chiral) space-time SUSY charge S [28], and projecting out all operators
which are not local w.r.t.[27] D. Friedan, A. Kent, S. Shenker and E. Witten, unpublished; T. Banks, L. Dixon, D.
Friedan and E. Martinec, Nucl.Therefore, the invariant way to describe the famous “c = 1 barrier” of [12],
is that 2d gravity coupled to matter with more than one field theoretic degree of freedom
is unstable.In particular, it doesn’t contain space-
time gravity.Therefore, the pole structure of (4.4) depends crucially on the physics of the states
V
(?)In two dimensional space-time they
seem to be closely related to the symmetry structure of the theory [24].Unlike there, it doesn’t seem likely that tachyons can
be gotten rid of by shifting to a nearby vacuum.Its pole structure and
the effective action which describes it may be used to study the space-time 2d gravity.Using the OPE (4.15) in generic tachyon
correlation functions we find that the contribution of regions of moduli space where vertices
approach each other is:
?15

a) The form (4.14) is exact for k1, ..., kN?1 > 0, kN < 0, which is the region in which all
the energies involved are positive (4.3); from the world sheet point of view this is natural
since positive energy perturbations correspond to small deformations of the surface [8],
and also because the integrals (4.4) converge there (after a certain analytic continuation
in the central charge [35]).

instanton number, that is, the case for which the second Chern class of the gauge
fields on M is trivial; in this case U can be globally defined.(for G = SU(N)).8 The four-dimensional generalization of this result is that the
moduli space of (stable) holomorphic vector bundles of rank N on a compact Ka¨hler
manifoldM is essentially the moduli space of (irreducible) antiself-dual gauge fields
on M (for G = SU(N)).9 Thus a generalization of Chern-Simons theory in terms of
the nature of its phase space would naturally lead us to antiself-dual gauge fields.The second stage of
reduction is performed by requiring

be useful in understanding these theories and algebras.There is considerable evidence that antiself-dual

Indistinguishability assumes a very simple form in

Fourier space: two densities are indistinguishable if the products of their Fourier coefficients
over any set of wave vectors summing to zero always agree.Since Fourier space offers an unorthodox but more effective route to the ordinary crys-
tallography of periodic materials, since Fourier space provides the simplest definition of
quasiperiodicity, and since the Fourier space route to crystallography applies equally well
to both periodic and quasiperiodic materials, the single advantage of ascending to super-
space in search of a classification scheme based on periodicity, is that it relieves one of
3
having to take a radical new look at the foundations of ordinary crystallography [12].[15] This is particularly clear for the pairs of JJdW Bravais classes associated with the
classes I have numbered 20, 21, and 22 in Table 2.A few years later Bravais
pointed out that two of the Frankenheim classes contained identical lattices, and today
the edifice of crystallography rests on a foundation of 14 Bravais classes [2].By building such distinctions
into the concept of Bravais class one unnecessarily creates different crystallographies for
5
displacively modulated crystals (where the distinctions are relevant) and quasicrystals or
incommensurate intergrowth compounds (where they are not); one obscures relations such
as that between the 3 Bravais classes of icosahedral quasicrystals and the 3 (not 4) (3+3)
cubic Bravais classes with tetrahedral symmetry, noted in the caption of Table 2; and
when one comes to compute the classes of phase relations (which give the space groups
in the periodic case and are currently displayed in the form of superspace groups in the
quasiperiodic case), by failing to recognize that some Bravais classes contain identical
3–dimensional lattices of wave vectors one ends up calculating and tabulating the same
information more than once.A direct derivation in
3-dimensional Fourier space of these 16 (3+1) and 9 (3+3) cubic Bravais classes is given
elsewhere [5].These and other anomalies in the existing generalization of crystallography
to quasiperiodic materials are unlikely to disappear until crystallographers abandon the
venerable but outdated enshrinement of periodicity as the sine qua non of their taxon-

its historic reliance on periodicity, one can avoid climbing up into superspace in search of

the discrete Gaussian model, there is no parameter corresponding to V0, but the two-point
function is consistent with equation (6.2) with f(V0) = 1/2 or V˜0 = 2.We are able to show, using a duality
argument, that this is exactly what happens and that the phase diagram is what was
found years ago [4] in the study of theta-dependence of the confinement-deconfinement

Then we only have three-point functions left
in the determination of G(zi), whose form is fixed by SL(2,C) invariance and
whose normalizations are the structure constants of the chiral algebra.It is interesting to ask
if other non-local chiral algebras can be constructed along the lines of the A(K)
algebras presented above.This picture and the ADE classification of modular invariant partition func-
tions [28] suggests that when K = 4m there exist new symmetry algebras differing
from the fractional supersymmetries A(K) by having additional fractional spin cur-
rents entering into the chiral algebra, similar to (5.6).In this
paper, we will assume that there is only one fractional spin current.The determination of ?K for the A(K) algebras (1.1) can be thought of as a
continuation of the program initiated by Zamolodchikov [1], in which one picks the
chiral operator content for a proposed chiral algebra, and calculates which values
of the structure constants and central charge (if any) are allowed by associativity.This is not
necessarily the most interesting case, but serves as an example of our approach
to the problem of constructing fractional supersymmetry chiral algebras.So far,
we have considered the case where the Virasoro algebra is extended by only one
additional current J (K).There is a large body of evidence that fractional supersymmetry chiral alge-
bras organize infinite sets of CFTs in the same way that local extended Virasoro
algebras do.(b) Next, we investigate the possi-
ble existence of new chiral algebras differing from the fractional supersymmetry
chiral algebras by having two or more J (K) currents, although still with the same
dimensions as in the A(K) algebra.+ 1, it appears
with a positive fractional power of (z ?12
fractional spin chiral algebras we must drop the locality assumption.We will see that for chiral algebras these constraints are sufficient to
solve for the structure constants.This paper is intended as a first step in
the exploration of fractional spin chiral algebras.Tye, Cornell preprint CLNS 91/1068, “Fractional

ABSTRACT
The fractional supersymmetry chiral algebras, A(K), in two-dimensional con-
formal field theory are extended Virasoro algebras with fractional spin currents
J (K).The goal of this
paper is to do the same for the fractional supersymmetry chiral algebras.(c) Finally, we address the possibility of con-
structing in our framework non-local chiral algebras with a fractional spin current
of dimension different from that of J (K).In Section 5 we discuss various issues related to the fractional supersymmetry
algebras and to non-local chiral algebras in general.These
are non-local algebras which enlarge the Virasoro symmetry algebra to include a
fractional spin current.

We can again simplify the problem somewhat by noticing that E0 will take care of
itself once we put the ~E into the desired form.For instance, we will see that the superconformal
structure does not need any such conditions while the semirigid case needs some first order
constraints.It is sometimes convenient to im-
pose further G-invariant “inessential” torsion constraints corresponding to normalization
conditions [6], as we will recall below.In this
paper, we provide an intrinsic or coordinate invariant definition of semirigid super Riemann
surfaces (SSRS) as well as ordinary super Riemann surfaces (SRS).Hence in particular the projection
from augmented N = 0 surfaces to ordinary ones is natural, and as we have already seen
that this gives the desired projection from TN = 0 surfaces to N = 0.We have given a coordinate invariant characterization of aG-structure.These “torsion constraints” are first order
conditions on any frame representing the given structure since the Lie bracket entering t
contains one derivative.The normalization conditions (3.1)
are easily seen to imply that
a(ij) = ?ija0
where a0 is some invertible function.This implies that b = D+?˜
+ is also invertible and hence
so is t+.If we begin with a complex supermanifold, then N -SRS have no
essential torsion constraints, generalizing Baranov, Frolov, and Schwarz [11], who consid-
ered N = 1.1 We will refer to semirigid surfaces with N -supersymmetry as “topological
N -SRS,” or TN for short.(5.5)
The corresponding family of augmented Riemann surfaces is again given by the rule (5.2):
z?In this coordinate system
Ei = {?We
lack global information regarding the moduli space of augmented superconformal surfaces.Semirigid surfaces (or SSRS) are patched together by restricted superconformal tran-
sition functions.Such restricted coordinate transformations then provide the transition functions to build a
TN = 0 SSRS [1].We now obtain a class of augmented Riemann surfaces parametrized by (m˜a, mˆa) using
the augmented transition functions
z?Begin with the case of TN = 0 following the discussion in [1].The condition R = 0 implies flat space; thus integrability conditions are sometimes called
flatness conditions, even though they may be given by first order constraints in other cases.(4.20)
We are now ready to show that there exists a superconformal coordinate transforma-
tion and suitable K2 for which F = LK2.

The
4
relevance of such “phase shift only” solutions is that k1 and k2 will generally not lie
in the same self-dual null plane.This T is of course
different from the stress tensor from the Yang-Mills action.that defines the null plane can be either anti-
self-dual or self-dual.Also, given the field strengths it is a non-local process
to find a representative J , however the J formulation could be considered as just
as fundamental as the Yang-Mills formulation.In light of the above relation between pure WZ models and self-dual systems we
briefly mention some work of Park [15].Note these
solutions are just scattering in a general chiral model, which is integrable, and so
in principle all solutions are known, but in practise are not trivial.In
5
chapter 3 we review the J-formulation of SDYM, in which the Yang-Mills fields are
written as derivatives of a pre-potential[10, 11, 12].To clarify this we extended some work
of de Vega [7] on the scattering of plane waves in SL(2,C).In particular for an integrable theory we would expect there to be solutions
where the scattering does not induce a change of momentum but only a phase shift.The symmetry
(3.5) clearly leaves the Yang-Mills potentials invariant and so J is not uniquely
given by the field strengths.With a fractional
Hirota ansatz he reduced Yangs equations to a large set of algebraic equations,
and was able to produce some scattering solutions.If such scattering is truly relevant to SDYM then
the decoupling of these planes would not occur, thus contradicting the perturbative
results.Ward, “Multi-dimensional integrable systems” in ‘Field theory, quantum
gravity and strings’ Vol 2 eds H. de Vega and N. Sanchez (1987).In certain cases the system
has obvious exact generic solutions and we relate these to the string predictions
for three particle scattering.Whilst if the ki form a self-dual plane then we have
?ij?In particular there are certainly some exact solutions which correspond
to 2 to 2 scattering with no momentum exchange but a non-zero phase shift.In chapter 2 we discuss the peculiarities of kinematics in a (2,2) space-time.Also, it is reminiscent of
Wittens work on (2,1) gravity [16] that the usual Yang-Mills perturbation theory
around Aµ = A¯µ¯ = 0 corresponds to expanding about Gµµ¯ = 0 and not around
the usual flat metric.We now want to exhibit a class of exact solutions by extending the work of de
Vega [7].

Figure 1: The geometrical operators ?L(z) are are defined by asking tha t L legs of polymers
emanate from z.Another alternative is to consider a field theory similar to the one of Isaacson and Lubensky

Z2 = Zc[2/3, 2] (166)
Summing both peaces gives rise to the result
Z = Z1 + Z2 = Zc[2/3, 6] = Zc[3/2, 4] (167)
This result is our proposal for the partition function of the percolation problem in the context
of twisted N = 2 supersymmetry.As was argued in [32] the statistics of such a polymer is the same
as the one of percolation perimeters.We shall
reconsider the problem of the theta point and flow between various multicritical polymer points in
[34].If we make analytic continuation to the low
temperature phase in a finite system, then take the thermodynamic limit, we get again a model
of dense contours with weight one.10

Now the mapping of dense polymers, that is the low temperature phase of the O(n) model for
n ?Although a naive examination of the loop expansion of say the O(n) model
gives a result one for this partition function (because all polymers disappear), as soon as some
polymer is allowed by changing the boundary conditions, the partition function of the system
grows exponentially with the volume due to the finite density.Consider therefore the percolation problem and its medial polygons on a rectangle of the square
lattice, and introduce as in the polymer case the partition functions

It corresponds to the picture of figure 5.Because we want the xi

be described diagonally as in figure 15.Also, the series of multicritical polymer points seems a good place to apply the ideas

Notice that, as in the k = 1 case, the free energy can be simply evaluated at the N = 2 point of
the ?k vertex model.We draw as in figure 14 a square with each face carrying
an e matrix with the appropriate label, and multiply the e’s from top to bottom, and inside a
given line, from left to right.If we introduce the 2 legs polymer operator, of conformal
weights h = h, whose correlations are defined by summing over configurations of a polymer loop
attached at two different points, one has, by standard scaling arguments
1
?matrix as giving the weights of the model.The second class of models is more adequately described in the language of twisted
N = 2 supersymmetry, and consists of an infinite series of multicritical polymer
points, which should lead to experimental realizations.They satisfy the same algebra,
but we define their charge as proportional to minus the maximum number of non contractible
loops (in the time direction) their insertion can make contractible (figure 19).Finally if we admit the likely hypothesis that connected correlation functions of x
i
operators and their conjugates are described by i loops joigning the two insertions we find, using
the generalized Coulomb gas mapping, the weights hxi = i/2(k + 2).It is reasonable to assume that the connected correlation function
with its antichiral conjugate is obtained by creating a pair of non contractible loops where x
is inserted, and destroying it when the conjugate is inserted: in other words by selecting the
configurations where a loop connects the two insertions as in figure 21.We showed
that the best point of view was to consider twisted N = 2 [11, 12], and that realizations of such
theories were nicely provided by the geometrical problems of polymers and percolation.Notice that at that point, the free energy can be evaluated in a
trivial way: every vertex has two possible states, so in the large volume limit where we can neglect
the special weight of non contractible loops we have
f = log 2 (20)
This point was actually studied in [10] from the point of view of twisted N = 2, and connected
with the percolation problem.Therefore the total weight of the graph turns out to be
wgraph =

)area?1
(31)
Now notice that
area = number of vertices of type x+ 1 (32)
Therefore we can evaluate the partition function by forgetting about the weights of contractible
loops and multiplying the weights of each vertex by a factor
?1 = 1, ?2 = 1/[2]q, ?3 = 1 (33)
It is also interesting to consider the correspondence between the geometrical vertices and the
expansion of the R?3 Geometrical Reformulation of the ?k Vertex Models

It is possible that the extrinsic Hausdorff
dimension is nonuniversal, i.e.There does not seem to be
any good reason to expect the inequality to be valid for the analytically continued
external Hausdorff dimension to d < 1.In the second half of the paper we discuss alternative definitions of the intrin-
sic Hausdorff dimension and derive naive scaling relations which relate the intrinsic
Hausdorff dimension to other critical exponents in any imbedding dimension.It is
not unreasonable to define a Hausdorff dimension in the grand canonical ensemble
relating the average area of surfaces to a diverging correlation length as the critical
point is approached.The inequality is only meaningful when the extrinsic Hausdorff
dimension is defined and this requires d ?We furthermore
derive a few naive scaling relations which relate the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension
to other critical exponents.If RN grows more slowly than any
power of N , then it is customary to say that the extrinsic Hausdorff dimension is
infinite.Recently the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension of discretized pure 2-dimensional
gravity has been studied numerically and found to be infinite [3] (see [4, 5] for
related older simulations) and in perturbation theory [6] using the Liouville for-
mulation.Branched polymers are easily seen to have extrinsic
Hausdorff dimension 4, see e.g.3 Scaling relations for intrinsic exponents
The above definition of the Hausdorff dimension is not the only possible one.We
define the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension ?int (if it exists) by the asymptotic formula
< N?1
N?1?These relations suggest that the intrinsic Hausdorff
dimension is infinite if the susceptibility does not diverge at the critical point.Unfortunately our inequality for the Hausdorff dimensions has no direct
bearing on this case.N

then we call ?ext the extrinsic Hausdorff dimension of the random surfaces in the
given model.Pro-
vided our scaling assumptions are valid, it is hard to escape the conclusion that
the Hausdorff dimension is infinite if the critical exponent of the susceptibility is
negative.2 Intrinsic and extrinsic Hausdorff dimension
Let TN denote the collection of all triangulations of the sphere with N vertices, one
of which is singled out and called the marked vertex.Several numerical
studies have been made of ?ext and the results are rather inconclusive, see [4, 5], but
indicate that the extrinsic Hausdorff dimension is infinite for negative imbedding
dimensions but becomes finite around d = 2 and may decrease to 4 at large d, where
one expects a branched polymer phase.for which the intrinsic and
extrinsic Hausdorff dimensions exist they satisfy the inequality
?int ?We conclude that the Hausdorff dimensions ?1 and
?2 must be different or at least one of the scaling assumptions is not valid.

The construction makes precise the relation between these extra
states and null vectors.Thus in these theories, the number of exceptional states is a lot larger than that of
the “normal” states, a situation quite different from the critical string.(M), the module contains an LZ state.Liouville Fock spaces are very different, a fact which has played
an important role in several contexts[7][9][10][11][5].It
remains true that the proportion of exceptional states of non-trivial ghost number to the
states of ghost number 0 is significantly greater than for the critical string.)The result is a state of ghost number +1 in the (+) Fock space, and we
have:
Theorem 2: The state |X(1)+?Precisely half of them are obtained from Theorem
1 above, since the special values of t at which the null vector vanishes on projecting
to both Fock spaces are clearly values for which the states we constructed above, and
hence their inner product, vanish.defined above is a LZ state of ghost number ?1.To find these extra physical states, we start with a primitive (1, s) Liouville null vector
(in the Liouville Verma module) and the (1, s) matter primary, combined into the state
|X(0)?6
We will construct physical states of ghost number ±1 starting from the state defined
above (this state is itself null, since its Liouville sector is null.)This is a remarkably simple result, and clarifies a conceptual point: although LZ
states are not themselves null, they are Q?B-variations of null states.The physical states of ghost number +1 are found to be

minimal model backgrounds, since each minimal model has only finitely many primary

S-matrices.We will provide checks on the N=2 scattering theories by verifying that the Casimir
energy obtained from the TBA goes over to the correct central charges in the UV limit.We will often label the

dimensions occurs in physical polymer systems where one extra bond (fermion) can be
distorted into n solitons and, thus, each soliton carries fermion number 1/n [27].It does not immediately follow that the S-matrices are a direct product of the N=0 soli-

cohomology ring, the ring we get depends on the Kahler class of the metric on M .To actually derive (4.1) in the context of
string theory (and define it properly for multiple covers of holomorphic maps)3 is achieved
by showing the topological nature of computation (and showing that on the cylinder it
can be rephrased as a computation in a topological sigma model [9] which is discussed
briefly in section 6).Introduction
One of the most fascinating aspects of string theory is the way it modifies our intuition
of classical geometry.Then I give some simple examples of this duality for bosonic strings (section 3).12
Moreover, it was found [20] that if the index of the singularity8 is integral and equal to the
number of variables xi minus 2, they are related to string vacua propagating on the Calabi-
Yau ‘manifold’ defined by (the possibly singular variety) W (xi) = 0 in weighted projective
space with a very particular Kahler metric.What is the other,
the complex ring, geometrically?However, it is clear that in this topological
description the ordinary cohomology ring has a more ‘natural’ origin, and it seems to be
‘preferred’.So in this way we map a difficult problem (computation of deformed cohomology
ring) to a simple problem (computation of the ring of a singularity) once we know the right
transformation.Superstring Vacua and Quantum Cohomology Rings

is a plea for the rational allocation of the limited funds society provides for high–energy
physics research.High–energy physics in America is threatened by
dilution (too many sacred laboratories), by dispersion (too many directions, with little
foresight and no corrective capacity) and by the reluctance of our community and its
sponsors to perform difficult but necessary triage.Aside from a few physics gems, it came on line far too late to succeed as a
forefront accelerator.The search for the secrets of matter and the universe is both glorious and
costly.Each great breakthrough required a leap in energy by a factor of
1000.The intermediate mass scale can be chosen to fit the low–energy values of ?, ?s and cos ?The majority of our colleagues — those who do physics in real time and choose not to
live at the very fringe of the high–energy frontier — will need and deserve funds that are
almost certainly to be pree¨mpted by our preoccupation with bigness.Thus, the next great discovery to be made — the nature of electroweak symmetry
breaking and the origin of mass — will be revealed in the multi–TeV domain: at the next
great hadron collider.We have learned a great deal since then.

the SG theory and MTM as two different realizations of the same theory.In par-
ticular, the complete S-matrices of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon (SSG) theory
has been derived by ‘unrestricting’ the restricted SSG theory.We explain the RSG theory in sect.3 starting with the SLq(2) quantum group

that the spin operator of the Potts model, when inserted at a boundary with free

theory because large-scale numerical simulations are more readily performed.From the Kac formula Eq.In addition, points on the boundary at

between different crossing events.In order to compute the above correlation functions using the methods of con-
formal field theory, we need to understand to which representations of the Virasoro
algebra the boundary operators belong.These probabilities are shown to
be invariant not only under changes of scale, but also under mappings of the region
which are conformal in the interior and continuous on the boundary.Recently [3], extensive numerical work has been carried out to estimate cross-
ing probabilities in rectangular geometries for critical percolation in very large but
finite lattices, with the principal aim of establishing their universality between dif-
ferent models.We conclude that crossing probabilities are indeed invariant under mappings which
are conformal in the interior and are piecewise conformal on the boundary, but that
this is not generic for all critical systems, for example when q 6= 1.(9)
where the correlation functions on the left and right hand sides refer to the new
and the old geometry respectively, and hi is the scaling dimension of ?i.According
to the fusion rules of conformal field theory [7], there is one such operator in the
Kac table which has such a simple operator product expansion with itself, namely
(r, s) = (1, 2).Such factors have
been treated explicitly for the Ising model with various boundary conditions [15].Although this condition is not applicable
to the q-state Potts model for general q, the fact that it does apply for q = 2
and q = 3 suggests that those operators whose position (r, s) in the Kac table
does not appear to change as a function of c(q) do correspond to representations
with null states even in the non-unitary case.

systems, which we are now going to describe.In relation to these remarks, let us finally
emphasize that the Ps Diff algebra, and indeed the whole KP-construction frame-
work, was used in [10,20] to formulate effective actions for string equations, implying
a possible interpretation of the higher orbit coadjoint action as an effective action for

One interesting property of string theory is that, in addition to the usual physical fields, it
possesses so-called isolated states.2
These isolated states (in the critical case, at zero momentum, as they must be since Lorentz
invariance is unbroken) are thus directly associated with global aspects of the embedding of the
string in space-time, once again suggesting a connection with a topological phase of the theory.It was found that there is a distinct such deformation for every solution
to a set of linearized, gauge covariant space-time equations of motion for the massless states of the
theory.[15] M. Evans and B. Ovrut, Phys.Consequently our
phase space consists of one field, the tachyon, and a tower of states which are remnants of the higher
massive modes of the string.The classical phase space is then isomorphic to this gauge-fixed
solution-space.It is defined as the
space of all solutions of the classical equations of motion modulo gauge transformations.Thus, having obtained the linearised
equations of motion and gauge symmetries, we now proceed to the construction of the classical phase
space.We derive the gauge invariances of the theory, and so investigate the classical
phase space, defined as the space of all solutions to the equations of motion modulo
gauge transformations.Conclusions
In summary, we have used the techniques of [11] to derive isolated states of string theory
in a very physical way; we obtained linearised equations of motion and the gauge symmetries, and
then derived the phase space as the set of all solutions, modulo gauge transformations.

Recently a lot of attention has been paid to black-hole solutions of two-dimensional
string theories [1, 2, 3], which are discretized by certain matrix models describing
c = 1 conformal matter coupled to the Liouville mode.Horne and G. Horowitz, Santa-Barbara preprint UCSBTH-91-39 (1991).Mann, Waterloo preprint WATPHYS TH-91/06 (1991).[39] T.

a powerful theoretical laboratory for seeing how ideas about black hole physics fare in
the context of string theory.In such models the

the pertinent ?-function factors cancel between Liouville and matter sectors [29].The family of black

Abstract
We show that, in string theory, the quantum evaporation and decay of black holes
in two-dimensional target space is related to imaginary parts in higher-genus string am-
plitudes.These
may be obtained by twisted products of one Euclidean and one Minkowskian two-
dimensional black hole.That this is indeed the case can be demonstrated explicitly
by looking at the four-dimensional black hole of ref.3In this sense two-dimensional target-space general covariance is considered as the gauge sym-
metry associated with the first excited string multiplet (graviton-dilaton).Several authors [8] have now extended the black-hole construction to higher-
dimensional target spaces by gauging more complicated groups,offering eventually
the hope of understanding black holes in four-dimensional target space.In this paper we have shown that the
evaporation of two-dimensional Minkowskian black holes can be understood as a
quantum instability appearing in higher genera, analogously to the normal decays
of massive string states [11].

Using the zero curvature formulation, it is shown that W-algebra transforma-
tions are symmetries of corresponding generalised Drinfel’d-Sokolov hierarchies.More gen-
eral matrix models, describing two-dimensional conformal field theories coupled
to two-dimensional gravity, have also been described in terms of Drinfel’d-Sokolov
hierarchies [2-4].In the further study of integrable hierarchies, an important question is that of
symmetries.The study of the symmetries of an integrable hierarchy then reduces to the
study of the transformations which preserve the zero-curvature conditions (2).The W-algebra is the
algebra of residual Kac?-Moody gauge transformations of the Hamiltonian reduction
of the WZW model which preserves the constraints and gauge fixing [10,11].(17) shows that the Boussinesque hierarchy equation (18) can be

This model is clearly inequivalent to the usual hermitian model, due to the

This is a special case of (2.7) with dU = d?d??A paper by

diagonalized by a superunitary transformation, except in certain singular cases.Section 2 of this paper describes the general properties of supermatrix models.Nevertheless, it is useful
to define such models by gauge-fixing, since they provide the closest super-analog of
Wigner’s model for the eigenvalue distribution of a physical operator.It is a
simple enough case to allow a direct comparison with the saddle point analysis of
the standard matrix model[4], and it is useful to know exactly how the supermatrix

Zmn(?)Since a c-type supermatrix can be decomposed into a two by two block matrix,
with bosonic matrices on the diagonal and fermionic ones off it, one may suspect
that they already contain enough ingredients to define a discretized superstring
model.One leads to a
perturbative structure which is reminiscent of, and perhaps identical to, the usual
Hermitian matrix models.

The result for k is consistent (in the classical limit c?In a recent project, we studied the quantum theory for the particular theory
of chiral gauge W3 gravity in considerable detail.(37)
As we mentioned before, another approach to W gravity, which avoids studying
the gauge sector altogether, is to use critical theories, i.e., theories which are such
11
that, by a specific choice of the background, all anomalies are made to cancel.This will promote the rigid affine symmetries to local gauge symmetries.Before turning to W3 gravity we will first look at induced pure gravity, which
shares many characteristics with W gravities but avoids the problems associated
with the non-linearities inherent to W symmetries.This functional is
related to the well-known Wess-Zumino-Witten action as follows [18, 19].(25)
The important observation is now that the differential equations (23) can be ex-
tracted from the Ward Identities defining the Sl(3,R) WZW functional, by imposing
certain constraints on the currents [21, 22, 26, 27].B364 (1991)

This phenomenon is due to the non-linearities in the W3 algebra.This is in fact a phenomenon which occurs often in two-
dimensional conformally invariant theories: a classical theory with local invariances
has as many invariances as there are gauge field components.The theory has also four gauge invariances: diffeomor-
phisms, local Lorentz and Weyl invariance.A priori one would expect that
taking 50 copies of this theory would save the day.Classically, the gauge
sector is then pure gauge (up to moduli).Indeed, the kinetic term in the induced action is closely related to an anomaly in
the gauge invariance, the strength of which is proportional to the level k.
The induced action for chiral gauge fields can formally be written as

that inverse scattering theory is well-suited to this problem, and we hope to investigate
this point more thoroughly in the future.11

From eqs.It can be regarded as an
equation for the space of string theories of a particular class ( in this case, the ones

Something very similar happens in the 4-d Schwarzschild solution with negative
mass.D.Kutasov and P.Difrancesco, Princeton preprint, PUPT-1237,1991.The situation is more like instabilities in the background of a
negative mass Schwarzschild solution in 4-dimensions, as we will indicate later.From the spacetime point of view,
in the background of the semi-infinite cigar solution (which is how the Euclidean
black hole solution looks) [2], we expect square-integrable solutions concentrated
around the cigar tip, which decaying exponentially towards the flat cylinder end of
the cigar.Conclusion
We indicate the operators in the conformal field theory which correspond to
unstable modes in the target space field theory.The black hole solution has nontrivial dilaton-graviton
background in which we can introduce tachyon perturbations [1,2,3,4].Calculation of one-loop correction around
such a stationary point is divergent and has to be defined by analytic continuation.The c = 1 matrix model
seems to be a solution with a nontrivial dilaton and tachyon background but with
a flat metric [9,10,11,12].Exclusion
of these operators would make this solution stable.To get the unstable modes of higher tensor fields which lead
to instability we look for some current algebra secondaries which are Virasoro
primaries.A6 (1991)

this black hole to an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom-like solution, which would then
represent the c = 1 matrix model [8,20, 9,10,11,12] and the particle absorption and
re-emission by this terminal black hole would be the tachyon scattering near the

From a mathematical point of view a classical mechanical system is fixed by giving a
phase space, which consists of a smooth manifold together with a closed non-degenerate 2
form (a symplectic form), and a specific function on the manifold which plays the role of a
Hamiltonian (determining the dynamics of the system).The reason why we consider the representation
theory only at q a root of unity is that in the applications of quantum groups to physics it
is these representations that appear to be the most important.As
we will see these Poisson Lie groups are closely related to the classical Yang-Baxter equa-
tion and it is them that we will ultimately quantize ( or more accurately their universal
enveloping algebras).It follows that the set of algebras is closed
under taking tensor products.36 (1988) 212

This instability has significant implications for the evolution of a magnetically charged
black hole.Eventually only a
single charge is left, and the evolution proceeds as described above.Abstract
Working in the context of spontaneously broken gauge theories, we show that the
magnetically charged Reissner-Nordstro¨m solution develops a classical instability if the
horizon is sufficiently small.The metric for the Reissner-Nordstro¨m solutions of this theory is precisely the same
as that given above for the Maxwell theory.The black hole is now described by a solution
of the type found in Ref.Eventually, enough of the magnetic charge will have
been emitted for the monopole instability to emerge.The Reissner-Nordstro¨m solution to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations describes
a spherically symmetric black hole endowed with electric or magnetic charge.We now investigate the stability of these solutions, beginning with the case of per-
turbations about the solution with unit magnetic charge.Looking at the case of a Reissner-Nordstro¨m solution
with rH <?Thus, these solutions appear to be the natural endpoints to which
the instability of the Reissner-Nordstro¨m solution leads.In such theories the Reissner-Nordstro¨m solutions of
higher charge presumably become unstable when their horizon is comparable to the the
size of the lighter monopole, with the singly charged solution remaining stable until it has
shrunk to the size of the heavier one.This solution is readily incorporated into a theory possessing classical magnetic mono-
pole solutions.This remark has little consequence in the case of electric
charge, since one only need add a field whose elementary particles are electrically charged.

Relativists have dealt
with the white hole by the cosmic censorship hypothesis, according to which white
holes and more general “naked singularities” never form from acceptable initial
data.One might have believed
that, because of the excellent short distance behavior, there would be no classical
singularities in string theory.In particular, the deviation of the mass of a magnetic black hole
from the classical value is likely to be a quantum gravity or string theory effect
of order e2/h¯c.The white hole violates the predictability of the classical
theory, as classically one cannot predict what it will emit.In particular it is at least conceivable that
the dark matter in our galactic halo could consist of magnetically charged black
holes.A proper understanding of this point will probably
help make it clear how much can be learned about real black holes from D = 2
string theory.It is reasonable to hope that their
work is a prototype for at least some aspects of the black hole problem.String theory with c = 1 or D = 2 is superficially a very similar system, with
the massless “tachyon” playing the role of the bosonized s-wave fermions.It is not clear that we should wish
for the truth of the conjecture.I think most physicists expect that Hawking radiation leads to complete disap-
pearance of neutral black holes.du dv

physics could be described by an effective two dimensional field theory.But it has been found recently that the very metric
ds2 = ?du dv/(1?uv) that is the essence of the black hole gives a conformal field
theory.Quantum mechanically, though, the idea that black
holes exist and white holes do not is paradoxical as the white hole is the CPT
conjugate of the black hole.(For instance, spherical stellar collapse from standard initial data gives a
spacetime that coincides with the Schwarzschild solution only in the exterior of
the collapsing star; the exterior contains the black hole singularity but not the
white hole singularity.))2 + 8) (5)

Our present
knowledge, in particular the rigorous and beautiful work of Go¨pfert and Mack [9] indicate
that this cannot be done by taking an ordinary, field theoretical, continuum limit.It is an open and important question
whether this self-avoidance can be replaced by some interaction of purely statistical origin.Having identified the genus of any strong coupling diagram it is
possible then to weigh the diagrams by a fixed factor raised to the power of the genus.By field theory universality these
terms, if sufficiently weak, have no effect in the continuum limit.The suggestion I would like to make is that maybe, the missing abstraction of the
universal features of the various versions of the Meissner confinement mechanisms in the
usual field theoretical framework can be found in a string theory.If there exists a correspondence
2
to a string theory it must be of a less direct kind [4].lattice
produces exactly the absolute self-avoidance effect that we required above; moreover, David
showed that the bare string coupling, if equal to 1
N
with integer N , could be exactly
3
incorporated into a O(N) lattice gauge theory with a single “plaquette” action of a special
form defined on the dual to the f.c.c.Hence, if there exists a
string representation of the broken phase of continuum ?4 in 3d it has no freely adjustable
string coupling constant, and in that case is very unlikely to be a weakly coupled string,
unless, for some special reason, the string coupling must actually vanish in which case we
end up with a free string theory.To do this in a precise way is the crux of the matter
when one attempts to associate a string theory with the strong coupling expansion surfaces
appearing in any gauge model [3].Such a theory would
have, as fundamental objects, “bare” excitations associated with mathematical smooth
closed curves, which interact during their evolution by spanning two dimensional surfaces
of higher genus embedded in 3d Euclidean or Minkowski flat space.I believe that the “RSOS” model David and I introduced [8] warrants a more detailed
examination and may provide us with some clues on whether the similarities between
the confinement mechanisms in various realizations of pU(1) gauge theories in 3d can be
abstracted into something universal within the framework of string theory.A more direct correspondence might
hold for N=4 supersymmetric Yang Mills: its UV finiteness may permit tuning a coupling
to a stringy “double scaling limit” for its Feynman diagrams organized in powers of 1/Nc
with Nc given by the gauge group.Any confining 3d pU(1) (three dimensional periodic U(1)) has string-like excitations.Both the O(N) and the U(N) gauge theories can be shown to be insensitive to the
addition to the action of terms that break local gauge invariance down to the centers of
the respective gauge groups.For ordinary four-dimensional gauge theories the prospects for this to actually
work in a direct way are pretty dim because the field theory has unmistakable point-
particle-like behavior in the ultra-violet and this seems to be impossible to reproduce in a
theory that is “stringy” all the way down to zero distance.Nevertheless, Polyakov and others went ahead and suggested that the broken phase
side of the second order transition in the 3d Ising ferromagnet is describable by a string
theory and some of the nontrivial critical exponents of the 3d Ising model can be calculated
within this string theory [5].This would be a very beautiful theoretical development;
however, unlike in the case of pU(1), the universal features of the transition are in this
case describable by an ordinary (albeit strongly interacting) field theory, and therefore the
string is not necessarily needed to abstract the generic features of the transition.But, there is a possibility that the essential features of the effects of surfaces going
through each other, can be incorporated by adding more, intrinsic, degrees of freedom
to the string.If either 3d Ising or 3d pU(1) gauge theories have some limit where a complete set
of observables can be extracted and represented by a string theory one has to ask what
the coupling constant of this string theory would be.

This clarifies the relationship between the linearised vpa and the generalised Drinfeld-
Sokolov reduction.After discussing the ‘vacuum
preserving algebra’ (vpa) for both types of algebra, we show that in the classical case this
contains a finite subalgebra if we define a ‘linearised’ Poisson bracket.Reductive algebras are algebras which have positive-definite classical limits.Our work suggests that W-algebras can be divided broadly into three categories: the re-
ductive algebras considered in this paper, other deformable algebras, and ‘non-deformable’
algebras which are only associative for specific values of c. There are several questions
which present themselves concerning each category.Thus, it may be instructive to
look for ‘maximal’ deformable subalgebras of such W-algebras.(2.18)
For this to be the quantisation of a classical W-algebra, we require that the right-hand side
be O(~).Let us now turn to the question of constructing the advertised finite Lie algebra from
classical and quantum W -algebras.By analogy, we refer to such algebras as positive-
definite classical algebras.We have now shown how to recover finite Lie algebras from positive-definite classical W-
algebras and reductive quantum W-algebras.Since the commutator algebra is a Lie algebra for all c
values by the assumption of deformability, the only obstruction to the vpa algebra restricted
to the generating fields satisfying the Jacobi identity was from such contributions.2 Finite algebras from W -algebras
If we want to classify extended conformal symmetries, or W -algebras, we should like to
attribute to them some easily computable characteristics which specify the algebra com-
pletely.We then discuss the possibilities of classifying deformable W-algebras which
fall outside this class in the context of automorphisms of Lie algebras.As an illustrative example we return to the Zamolodchikov
algebra WA2, this time in its quantised version.By deformable
we mean that the algebra satisfies the Jacobi identity for a continuous range of values of
the central charge c. In general the structure constants of the algebra are allowed to be
functions of c. The algebras excluded by this restriction are a very complicated set of
objects, which in principle include, for example, a large number of W-algebras which can
be constructed from lattices using vertex operators [14, 15].We can also prove that the superalgebra
consists of the direct sum of simple (super)-algebras and an abelian Lie algebra in an
analogous manner to that above for purely bosonic W-algebra vpa’s.To extend this idea to more general non-linear quantum W-algebras, it became
necessary to consider deformable W-algebras which are defined for a range of c values in
the classical limit c ?Let us begin by discussing the relationship between quantum W-algebras and their
classical counterparts.Let us now consider classical W -algebras.We enumerate
the algebras which, in addition, contain no generating spin-2 fields besides the Virasoro
algebra.

they are described by a classical field configuration.We
find that there is also an upper limit on their mass.The behavior of the fields at the outer edges of the monopole core is
determined largely by the shape of the position-dependent field potential U at that

that the variation of the action with respect to v(x, u) implies the equation

the following, the harmonic-space action proposed in [13] does result in F being a (1, 1)

The harmonic space description of SDYM has been seen to be closely related to the
twistor construction of Yang-Mills instanton solutions [2, 3, 15].(2.27)

Kalitzin and Sokatchev proposed an action for SDYM theory that uses a lagrange-multiplier
field P (?3)µ(x, u) to enforce this condition [13].Since the only gauge-invariant function of A
+
µ
is F++, which vanishes identically, the one-loop effective action must vanish in this gauge.It has been conjectured that this may be because the action
does not preserve enough of the geometric structure and symmetries of SDYM.[20], it is in some sense more natural to take V ++
as the basic field in harmonic-space SDYM.1 Introduction
Self-Dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) theory appears to be a basic ingredient of various areas
of research in Physics and Mathematics.1 Generic one-loop Feynman diagrams.246B (1990) 423; “Kahler Chern-Simons theory
and symmetries of antiselfdual gauge fields”, Columbia preprint CU–TP–521;
See also the first reference of ref.As discussed above, the one-loop action contains only v fields, with no P (?3) fields, and
the v fields have to appear in the form A+µ .gauge fields with self-
dual field strengths F [2, 3].The theory
therefore gives the equations of motion of SDYM.3 One-loop background field diagrams.The equations of motion derived from the harmonic space action (2.28) are not simply
F (2,0) = F (0,2) = 0 in a 3-complex dimensional space.The lagrange multiplier fields enforce the condition that F is a (1, 1) form, and
18
the equation of motion of At implies that F ?This statement will hold as
long as the theory is one-loop finite, so that the structure of the action is not spoiled by
counterterms.

field to be a modulus field we must also have
?(V?)n?The modulus field ?We defer until later the discussion on the third modulus field T3 (which appears
to be related to the fields ?4 and ?5).We further argued that
the effective action obtained in the string basis (after a suitable field redefinition) can be
recast to manifestly display its invariance under modular transformations.(1.3) by the higher order terms in the superpotential and higher derivative terms in
the effective action.From explicit S-matrix calculations we know that some of these nonrenormalizable
terms are definitely nonzero, we conclude then that their coupling must be such as to screen
out the modular weight.In a supergravity theory [17], one may “choose” the superpotential such that it is
already endowed with covariant properties under modular (or Ka¨hler) transformations.(2.2b)
Hence, we see that the strong constraints that modular transformations might lead to
cannot be uncovered until one considers higher-order (nonrenormalizable) terms in the
superpotential.Note that since the trilinear term is modular
covariant by itself, no such correction is necessary.The phenomenological implications of the structure of the nonrenormalizable terms
dictated by modular invariance are self evident.Here we see that it is the modular invariance of the theory which is
responsible for the observed stability.9
We have verified explicitly that for free fermionic models, the structure of the nonrenor-
malizable terms implied by modular invariance is indeed present.B 289 (1987) 589; M. Dine, I.
Ichinose, and N. Seiberg, Nucl.Knowing the wI charges of the fields it is straightforward to determine
the “deficit” modular weight of a particular term.A similar analysis for the quintic and higher
order terms also bears out the premise that all nonrenormalizable terms are accompanied
by a proper modular function such as to make the superpotential modularly covariant.Hence for the superstring
effective action to be invariant under modular transformations, the explicit calculation of
the superpotential must exhibit the covariant properties which are by no means obvious.A 5 (1990) 479; M. Dine and C. Lee, Nucl.Now we turn our attention to the main topic of this paper, the modular transformation
properties of the superpotential W .Furthermore, the inclusion of nonperturbative effects of a strongly interacting gauge theory
requires additional modifications of the effective action [3].

Note that if we had not dropped the third term in the (1,2) partition
function (4.28), we would have required a third string-function expression C4
to relate to
RK=2,D=63 ?Thus we see again (this time on the partition-function level) that
by leading directly to these string-function expressions and identities, the frac-
tional superstring construction does indeed provide us with a natural means of
generalizing the traditional string theories.The first possibility is that a given (1,2) spacetime-supersymmetric model
may fail to have a partition function of the form (5.4).The crucial
difference, however, is that the heterotic (1,K) theory is in its critical dimension
for all values of K.
For completeness, we should also note that it is possible, just as in the (1,2)
case, to consider (1,K) theories in spacetime dimensions D <Dc.In this paper we shall assume the underlying consistency of the fractional
superstring and concern ourselves primarily with examining the space of models
that such fractional string theories allow; other important issues, such as un-
derstanding the underlying Fock-space structure of these theories, constructing
4
scattering amplitudes, examining the ghost system and developing a no-ghost
theorem, are actively being pursued.DICTIONARIES FOR MODEL-BUILDING

using the expressions (3.30) and (3.31), we now turn our attention to the con-

spacetime supersymmetry must therefore have partition functions built from

for the K = 4 and K = 8 theories, are completely new features arising only for
the K > 2 fractional superstrings, and as such they are responsible for much of
the new physics these strings contain.These two expressions have, of course, already
been determined: Z(1,1) in (3.2) is merely ?2?12|A1|2, and ?2?4|A2|2 is merely
a special (spacetime-supersymmetric) case of Z(2,2) in (3.5).VI with our discussion of various fur-
ther issues in fractional superstring model-building, among them the creation
of (1,4) models with chiral fermions and the necessity of compactifying or in-
terpreting the (1,4) models in four spacetime dimensions.However,
the dictionaries we will be developing for these models rest on very general
principles, and we expect this dictionary idea to be equally applicable to other
methods of (1,2) model-construction as well.It is therefore apparent
that this fractional superstring language provides a natural framework in which
to classify and uniformly handle all of the traditional string theories, and in so
doing it also points the way to their non-trivial generalizations.In fact, use of these parafermionic string functions allows us to collect to-
gether in a simple way all of the partition function forms we have considered
for the general (KL,KR) theory in arbitrary dimension D ?To date, the only known consistent string theories are
the superstring theory
[1]
and the closely-related heterotic string theory,
[2]
yet
one of the significant problems involved in superstring model-building in four
spacetime dimensions is the existence of a multitude of classical solutions which
these string theories allow.Thus, by appropriately
choosing K and building the corresponding worldsheet fractional supersymme-
try as discussed above, we can hope to obtain a series of new string theories
with a variety of critical dimensions.We
remark that in principle it is just as straightforward to construct dictionaries
suitable for building (2,4) models; indeed, the expressions RK=2,D=6i which we
have obtained can themselves be taken as the partition-function contributions
from the self-consistent left-moving sectors of such theories.Tye, Fractional Supersymmetry
and Minimal Coset Models in Conformal Field Theory, Cornell preprint
CLNS 91/1057 (1991).We concentrate on the cases with critical
spacetime dimensions four and six, and find that a correspondence can be drawn
between the new fractional superstring models and a special subset of the tradi-
tional heterotic string models.We therefore obtain the fractional supersymmetry current
J = ?µ ?Xµ + : ?Thus, when building a model, one must satisfy essentially two kinds of
constraints: those which involve the left- and right-moving sectors of the theory
independently (guaranteeing that they are each internally self-consistent), and
46
those (i.e., modular invariance and the implied level-matching) which insure
that they are properly coupled or linked to each other.

Now assume that

An entirely different state of affairs holds for a test string moving in the background
of a source fivebrane or, by duality, a test fivebrane moving in the background of a source
string.However, only the choice a = 2/3 enters into the string-
fivebrane and fivebrane-string calculations of section 4, and so in this context we do not
attach any physical significance to other choices.]Since the mass per unit 5-volume of the fivebrane is given by M6 = T6[2],

source fivebrane oriented along xa = ?a, (a = 1, ..., 5).However, in section 4 we found that the string-fivebrane and fivebrane-string
singularities were harmless.In these respects they seem to differ from the heterotic fivebrane solution
of Strominger[7] and the heterotic string solution of Duff and Lu[8] where the singularities
are smeared out by the presence of the Yang-Mills fields.= 1/2?T2 using the methods of conformal field theory[11],
one can only conjecture that the string solution can be shown to be an exact solution of
fivebrane theory to all orders in ??Moreover, whereas the fivebrane solution can be shown to be an exact solution of
string theory to all orders in ??One can prove rigorously that S(string) of
(2.1) describes the field theory limit of string theory and that the string loop coupling con-
stant is, from (2.4) given by g(string) = e?0 ; one has only plausibility arguments that the
dual action S(fivebrane) describes the field-theory limit of fivebrane theory and that the
fivebrane loop coupling constant is, from (2.9), g(fivebrane) = e?In other words, the fivebrane never sees
the singularity, and as far as the fivebrane is concerned, the string singularity is not real.The actions S(string) and S(fivebrane) become dual to each other if we make the
identification[9,10]

In section 3 we found that the string-string and fivebrane-fivebrane singularities were
real in accordance with the results of (2.5) and (2.10) that both the string metric in string
variables and the fivebrane metric in fivebrane variables exhibited curvature singularities
at r = 0.?0/3 and hence that the
strong coupling limit of the string corresponds to the weakly coupled fivebrane and vice-
versa[9].Conclusion
We have seen that, as far as singularities are concerned, the superstring and the super-
fivebrane solitons are on an equal footing: the fivebrane is a singular solution of fivebrane
theory but a non-singular solution of string theory while the string is a singular solution
of string theory but a non-singular solution of fivebrane theory.An analogous calculation for the fivebrane solutions of Duff
and Lu also yielded a vanishing lowest order dynamical force on a test fivebrane in the
background of a source fivebrane with identical orientation.By contrast, in section 4, we show that if one is a string and the other a
fivebrane, the singularity is harmless.

The Liouville mode decouples in a modified
version of 2-d quantum gravity called topological gravity, much like string theory in the
critical dimension.To understand
the semirigid moduli space, we introduce a family of augmented surfaces.Thus, there is hope for one to continue to
show the rest of the recursion relations involving Riemann surfaces with different genera are
reproduced in the topological semirigid gravity.A semirigid surface ?ˆ with a unit disk |zP (·)| < 1 removed (?ˆ, zP (·)) is shown.on a semirigid surface, then P can be defined by where f = ?In the following,

two surfaces by relating the coordinates zL|?L and zR|?R centered at the sewing points PL

The p/q factor in the front of Z seems to be an artifact of the calculation as it drops
out in the normalized three-point function.For that we need to know the two point functions of the
operators involved and the partition function.This has been strengthened in recent times by the zero-
mode integration technique [8] and the subsequent calculation of the three-point
function [9]; the calculation of three-point functions by adding marginal pertur-
bations to the free Liouville action [10]; the computation of the torus partition
function [11] and through the BRST analysis of the physical states of minimal
matter coupled to gravity [12] [13] [14].The normalized correlation function
also agrees with three-point function of tachyon operators [23] if the momentum
of the tachyon kr,s is identified with

.The reason is that in
the case of non-unitary theories the matter operator of least dimension is not the
identity and this modifies the matter contribution, which needs further screening.The advantage of this approach is that the screening charges are raised to an
integral (albeit negative at times) power and the analytic continuation procedure
is simpler to carry out.N10 V. Dotsenko, Paris

The remarkable fact
is that, in the supersymmetric theory, the expansion of cwzw in powers of k
?1 terminates
at first non-trivial order and no modification of the dilaton field is needed to maintain the
desired central charge of six.Finally, we may

solutions.The gauge potential which follows from taking f to have a

theory.While (5.24) is in some sense the most obvious supersymmetric fivebrane solution,
there is in fact a different solution with more worldsheet supersymmetry.For string
theory consistency, it must have a central charge of 6, which would be trivially true if the

from (5.1) are
??Algebraic CFT Approach
It is one thing to show that a sigma model is a superconformal field theory, as we
have done in the previous section, and quite another to be able to classify its primary field
content and calculate n-point functions of its vertex operators.Now let us further specialize to the sigma model underlying the left-right symmetric
(and therefore non-anomalous) fivebrane solution of section 5.This charge also plays a key
role in the GSO projection which rids the theory of tachyons.Finally, soliton solutions typically depend
on a finite number of parameters called moduli which act as coordinates on the moduli
space of soliton solutions of fixed topological charge.The models of interest to us are structurally equivalent to a compactification of
ten-dimensional spacetime down to six dimensions: there are six flat dimensions (along the
fivebrane) described by a free field theory and four ‘compactified’ dimensions (transverse
to the fivebrane) described by a nontrivial field theory.In fact the existence of such an
exact solution can be demonstrated using low-energy spacetime supersymmetry.One is the fact that the static
force between two monopoles of like charge or between two gauge bosons of like charge
vanishes.The general proof was given quite some time ago by Alvarez-Gaume
and Freedman [33] and assumes that (4, 4) supersymmetry is not explicitly broken at the
quantum level.Thus quantum effects due to exchange of solitons will be non-perturbative
effects which vanish to all orders in perturbation theory.(This fact may be useful in future attempts to quantize the transverse fluctuations of the
fivebrane.)There are many fivebrane applications of
this exact throat conformal field theory which are just beginning to be worked out.In
addition, the vanishing of the potential is not natural from the quantum point of view so
there is no reason to expect the mass formula to be exact when quantum corrections are
included.

this would have produced a topological theory with the set of physical observables being
represented by the anti-chiral fields, those superfields annihilated by Q?However, there is an important difference between topological quantum field theories

c-function, but we shall provide an example below in which the infrared critical limit of
the maximum eigenvalue of Q is approached from below, and hence is not a non-increasing
function of the renormalization group flow parameter.Hence we have exhibited the complete behavior of the
topological sector of the theory which interpolates between two nontrivial conformal field
theories along the renormalization group flow trajectory.The
infrared limit of this theory should correspond to some (possibly trivial) conformal field
theory.Introduction
The set of conformal field theories are the infrared or ultraviolet fixed points, or
critical points, of renormalization group flow trajectories in the space of two-dimensional
quantum field theories.This class of correlation functions is known as the topological sector of N = 2
field theories, and is closely related to the correlation functions of physical observables
in topological quantum field theories [14].These models are described
by a Lagrangian density defined in terms of the chiral (and anti-chiral) superfields of the
theory by
L = 12
?Using the results of these studies, S. Cecotti and C. Vafa found that
the requirement that gij¯ be a nonsingular, positive-definite metric will uniquely determine
the required boundary conditions of the solution to the above differential equation.Hence the physical requirement of the
regularity of the solution, combined with the differential equations (3.23), may completely
determine the metric, including its values at the critical point, which gives the normalized
20
values of the operator product expansion coefficients of the corresponding conformal field
theory.(5.13)
Now requiring that g be a Hermitian matrix requires that ?We wish to calculate the metric gij¯ as a function of the renormalization group scale
?, so it is convenient to perform one more field redefinition so that the dependence on ?In this paper we shall apply their results to the nonperturbative calculation of
the topological sector of a theory which interpolates between two conformal field theories
along the renormalization group trajectory connecting them.(2.12)
This is equivalent to redefining the coupling of the theory to two-dimensional gravity using
the fermion numbers of the fields.S. Cecotti and C. Vafa have described this construction as an anti-topological theory, thus
leading to the notion of the topological sector of N = 2 field theory as being the fusion of
a topological theory and an anti-topological theory.

We have made clear the relation between the LZ states and the DK states and how
correlators with one kind of operators is mapped into correlatiors of the other kind.It is clear that the process would work out for the general case also, where we have
a set of three operators such that the total ghost number is zero.One of these is the usual string BRST operator for the theory
and the other is the BRST operator associated with the screening operators of the Coulomb
gas formalism as in the work of Felder[12].In the matter
case, this is encoded in the diagram given in Figure 1.It would be interesting to apply our descent procedure in the case of WN
gravity coupled to matter.Note that ghost num-
ber conservation for LZ operators translates to tower number conservation for DK type
operators.In our setting, the DK type states are all in a
‘fixed picture,’ measured by the difference of the charges of matter and Liouville vertex
operators, which is, in fact, zero.This in a
calculation with only LZ operators would be difficult to see.in (3.10) is not truly QB exact since wm?,m
is not in the Felder cohomology.4 A similar argument holds for |DK?There is one obvious class of states that are in the QB
cohomology.So all the vm?,m’s from every Fock tower in the Felder complex suitably dressed are in
the cohomology.In terms of operators it is particularly
easy to compute as the vertex operator charge of the matter and Liouville sectors precisely
differ by a 2?0 and a 2?0 when we write them as DK type operators, thus requiring no
screening in either sector.Double Cohomology of QB and QF
The cohomology of the string BRST for c < 1 matter coupled to Liouville is the object
of interest here.

The problem was greatly
simplified by the fact that two of the symmetry charges act as ?x and ?y.For the NSR string we can simply proceed with the full theory, and
thus produce a 2D NSR closed string with the same ground ring structure and symmetry
as the 2D bosonic string.This ring can be identified as the polynomial ring generated by two elements.For the 2D NSR string one
immediately finds that the ground ring – at the “critical” point where the cosmological
constant vanishes – is just the ring of polynomial functions on the quadric cone Q defined
by
a1a2 ?This product, and the definition of symmetry current, may be immediately taken over
to the NSR string, and we will soon consider just how much of the other structure does
also.This contains directly the results required
for the 2D NSR string, which are then applied in Section 3 to obtain the ring structure
and the algebra of charges for one chiral sector – both for the 2D NSR string, and its
GSO projection.For example, if all of the cohomology Hd0(C) is
concentrated in a single degree k (note that this allows for various orders n with nontrivial

of this theory.More recently there has been some suggestion [9,10]
that the model should be interpreted in terms of a three dimensional theory.In particular, a rather trivial observation is that
?r increases the degree by r, so often one can deduce that it is zero by simply examining
the set of degrees in which Er is nontrivial.2ZZ+, the d?0 cohomology is built from the oscillators ?+?r and c?r, and at the
level rs2 (L0 = 0) there are only two such states (both of the same degree) for s ?In fact, as perhaps one could also anticipate from the kinematic analysis, the chiral

It was recently established for the 2D bosonic string that the operator cohomology
contains a natural ring structure, and that relative cohomology states at gh = 0 give rise
to a symmetry algebra which acts as derivations of the ring [9].The GSO projected chiral ring is just the polynomial ring generated by x and

saddle point analysis is that given in [3] for vector models.We give herein the solution of rectangular N ×M matrix models in a ‘triple-scaling’
regime—N and M are taken to infinity independently in correlation with the approach to
critical matrix couplings.Another Higher Order Singularity
At the end of section 3, we mentioned that when the split singularity degenerates at
y2 = 1, the scaling solution is similar to that found in section 5.However, such
11
singularities do not arise in the triple-scaling solution of rectangular matrix models.Based on the surface interpretations that are suggested by finite M,N
computations[2,3], the new dynamics that can be investigated in the triple-scaling analysis
would appear to involve microscopic topology fluctuations.

this generalization is not entirely straightforward.Our purpose is to remind the reader of two peculiar features of nonabelian strings.Cheshire charge and the Borromean rings
As discussed in Section 2.2, it is an inevitable consequence of the nonabelian
Aharonov–Bohm phenomenon that a loop of string (or a pair of vortices) can carry
charge, and can exchange charge with other charged objects.First, we seek assurance that the exotic physics of the
nonabelian Aharonov–Bohm effect, previously inferred in the weak–coupling limit,
actually survives in a fully quantum field–theoretic treatment.Aharonov, Y. and Bohm, D., Phys.This transformation moves the Dirac strings without

Two string loops C1 and C2 are

each string is a flux eigenstate, with
h(C1, x0) = h1 ,
h(C2, x0) = h2 .Thus, our previous analysis applies, without modification, to
the transfer of topological charge between a “global monopole” and a “global Alice
string.”
Recently, Brekke, Fischler, and Imbo
[21]
have independently investigated the prop-
erties of magnetically charged Alice strings.The transfer of topological charge can be described in a
manifestly gauge–invariant way.This electric field has no locally identifiable source; it is “Cheshire
charge.”
The charge transfer process is sketched in Fig.But if the string is not an Alice string, the magnetic charge will not be Cheshire

charge, there is no need for charge conjugation to be a local symmetry.[3?5]
Such charge with no locally identifiable source has been called “Cheshire
charge.”

An Alice string can also carry magnetic Cheshire charge, and can exchange
magnetic charge with magnetic monopoles.Aut (pi2[M, x0]) (4.3)

where p is the charge in units of the Dirac magnetic charge, e is the gauge coupling,

and R is the size of the loop.For the purpose of defining the magnetic charge
carried by a particular string loop, it is convenient to introduce an (arbitrary) “base-
point,” and a canonical surface (or homotopy class of surfaces) that encloses the
loop and is tied to the basepoint.But if two string loops link, the magnetic
charge on each individual loop is not well defined in general.(We will see in the next section that
magnetic charge transfer results from a related topological interaction.)String loops are invariant under the center of
SU(2), and so can have no “two-ality.”
The semiclassical quantization of the charge rotor of the Alice string is strongly
reminiscent of the corresponding treatment of bosonic superconducting strings.To define the magnetic flux
we must specify a basepoint x0 and a closed loop C that starts and ends at x0 and
encircles the string exactly once.In the
case of magnetic charge, we note that the charge on a string is really a topological
charge, and that the transfer of charge from magnetic monopole to string has an

essentially topological origin.

New three generation
orbifolds are found only for tadpole and loop type theories.This question is of particular interest if the goal is to produce orbifolds with presribed spectra, say
models with a small number of fields where the difference between the number of generations and
antigenerations is three.One way to achieve this is to orbifoldize the theory
with respect to the U(1) symmetry of the N = 2 superconformal algebra.These symmetries lead to a large number of orbifolds not all of which are distinct however for reasons
explained in the previous section.In this section
we thus specialize the above considerations to this case and describe how we obtained our list of 7579
different LG potentials.Our computations have concentrated on the number of generations
and anti–generations of these models and we have found some 2000 distinct Hodge pairs 5.# Configuration Potential Action Spectrum

ABSTRACT
We construct a class of Heterotic String vacua described by Landau–Ginzburg theories and consider
orbifolds of these models with respect to abelian symmetries.There are two aspects to
this question, as mentioned in the introduction – low numbers for the difference of generations and
anti–generations (more precisely one wants the number 3 here) and low values for the total number of
generations and anti–generations.5 Abelian symmetries of LG potentials
In this section we first determine pure phase symmetries in the canonical basis (9-12).We have stopped implementation of more complicated actions when the
number of results for the different orbifold Hodge pairs was of the order of a few tens.At this particular point
in moduli space we can, e.g., consider the orbifolds with respect to the actions
ZZ3 : [ 0 0 1 0 2 ] , (13, 79,?132)
ZZ3 : [ 1 1 1 0 0 ] , (13, 79,?132)

Vector and matrix models share also other properties: Perturbation theory is always
divergent [9] and half of the vector models (like for matrix models) are ill-defined beyond
perturbation theory because perturbation theory is non-Borel summable and the corre-
sponding potential is not bounded from below.We have
thus shown that for d < 4 a scaling limit exists which leads to a renormalized ?3 field
theory.While matrix models are associated with surfaces because the large N
limit selects planar Feynman diagrams, vector models are associated with one-dimensional

We have studied the large N limit.Of particular interest is the general-
ization to models containing fermions (in particular supersymmetric models).General O(N)-invariant vector models.In matrix models similarly there is a competition be-
tween the potential and a measure term which produces a repulsion between eigenvalues,
although the detailed mechanism is slightly different.O(N) invariant vector models have been shown to possess non-trivial scaling
large N limits, at least perturbatively within the loop expansion, a property they share
with matrix models of 2D quantum gravity.However, because we want to extend the
analysis to field theory, we use here a more general method, which directly shows the
relation between the vector model and a model of branched polymers embedded in one
dimension.Obviously more general models can be
analyzed by similar methods, for example by introducing several vector fields additional
degrees of freedom for the polymers are generated.q=1

Vector models have, in zero dimension, in the large N limit, critical points and scaling
behaviours [1,2,3] that are reminiscent of those of matrix models relevant to 2D quantum
gravity [4,5,6].(5.2)
Note that only the lnN/N term is universal, the 1/N term is regularization and renormal-
ization dependent.

The Aharonov-Bohm effect is generally thought to be inextricably connected
to gauge symmetry, and to quantum mechanics.is the spinor field representing the particle.However since the Nambu-Goldstone field is
derivatively coupled, it is clear that on general grounds its emission is an order
(k/F )2 correction to the elastic process for small momenta, where F is the scale
of symmetry breaking.While
gauge charges have a universal coupling strength, global charges do not, and so it is
difficult at first hearing to understand how an essentially geometrical, parameter-
independent form of the cross-section could emerge for them.The main point emphasized
above, that frame-dragging phenomena usually associated with gauge theories also
occur at low momenta for broken global symmetries, opens the strong possibility
that effects closely analogous to these can be realized in suitable laboratory con-
densed matter systems.However, even
below this threshold, the off-diagonal terms can affect the elastic scattering of the
?2 modes at second order in perturbation theory.Thus, for single quanta, it appears quite different
from an Aharonov-Bohm scattering effect.We will also consider the quantum mechanical scattering problem, although
similar considerations would apply to the classical scattering of waves.The off-diagonal entries (terms
linear in the induced effective gauge field) connect states of different effective mass.In analyzing the
dynamical effect of this frame dragging, it is convenient to work with fields which
have a definite mass.We make these remarks not so much to outrage conventional wisdom concern-
ing the Aharonov-Bohm effect, as to motivate the possibility of generalizing it.One might be concerned that, since the Nambu-Goldstone excitations associ-
ated with the broken symmetry field ?Our strategy will be to first solve the scattering problem ignoring the
off-diagonal terms, and then take them into account perturbatively.Notice that the

even if the four-dimensional theory has zero cosmological constant.3
black holes [16, 17], and the study of rotating four-dimensional black holes has not
altered the dilemma, so we emphasize here spherically-symmetric four-dimensional
black holes 2.A simple counting argument indicates that the number of such (1, 0) and (0, 1)
operators in a four-dimensional string theory is comparable to the entropy (2) of
a massive black hole, and hence might be adequate to accommodate this entropy
without the necessity of a mixed state.[14] E. Witten, Institute for Advnaced Study, Princeton preprint IASSNS-HEP-
91/51 (1991).The latter, in view of the validity of the S-matrix formalism due to the
W -hair property of the string black holes, implies due to the optical theorem a decay
with a decay rate ?These are described by dimensional reduction of four-dimensional
string theories.In this paper we extend these arguments to argue that four-dimensional string
black holes do not lead to mixed states, and hence that string reconciles quantum
mechanics with general relativity also in four dimensions.3 Spherically-Symmetric Four-dimensional Black
Holes
We note first that the original arguments given by Hawking referred to spherically-
symmetric black holes originated by the spherically-symmetric collapse of macro-
scopic matter [17].There is also an apparent temperature
T =

2The extension of our arguments to rotating black holes is technically more complicated, but
presumably does not raise any fundamental issues of principle, since string has infinitely many
gauge symmetries.5 Conclusions
We have argued that spherically-symmetric four-dimensional objects with phys-
ical curvature singularities and event horizons (black holes) can be described by
effective two-dimensional string theories.[36] H. Stefani, General Relativity (Cambridge University 1982).Thus, there is no modification of the evolution
equation of the density matrix in the presence of a spherically symmetric black hole
[15], and the factorisation of Hawking’s superscattering operator holds.However, the arguments of [11] imply instabilities in spherically-symmetric black
hole solutions, since these are massive string states and as such should be able to
decay to lighter states [28, 29].[24] G. Moore and N. Seiberg, Rutgers preprint RU-91-29, YCTP-P19-91 (1991).The latter expresses decay of the massive stringy black hole state due to instabil-
ities induced by the string propagation in summed up world-sheet topologies.

G0, the little group of M0 in G. Next we introduce
some notation which will be useful for describing the effective theory., M0 , M+} of the arbitrary but non-compact simple real Lie algebra G. Clearly, if
one imposes first class constraints of the type described in Section 3.3 on the currents of
the WZNW theory then the resulting effective field theory will have the required chiral
algebra.If {M?,M0,M+} is the principal sl(2) embedding
in G, with commutation rules as in (3.34) below, we simply choose the one-dimensional
gauge algebra ?General structure of KM and WZNW reductions
The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the general structure of those reductions
of the KM phase space and corresponding reductions of the full WZNW theory which
can be defined by imposing first class constraints setting certain current components
to constant values.Polynomiality in KM reductions and the WGS -algebras
In the previous chapter we described the conditions for (2.2) defining first class
constraints and for LH(J) in (2.10) being a gauge invariant quantity on this constraint
surface.(This is allowed since the
WZNW dynamics leaves the constraint surface invariant, i.e., the WZNW Hamiltonian
weakly commutes with the constraints.)(3.69)
It is easy to verify that the original constraint surface (3.56) can be recovered from (3.69)
by a partial gauge fixing in such a way that the residual gauge transformations are exactly
the ones belonging to the space D. In fact, this is achieved by fixing the gauge freedom
corresponding to the piece (P 1
2
+ P1) of ?, (3.63), by imposing the partial gauge fixing
condition
?qi(x) = 0 , qi ?We shall find that for the generalized Toda theories
associated with integral gradings the effective measure takes the form determined from
the symplectic structure of the reduced theory.16
The gauged WZNW theory we are interested in is given by the following action
functional:
I(g, A?, A+) ?We now come to the main point of the section, which is that the reduced WZNW
theory, defined in the above by using the Hamiltonian picture, can be identified as the
gauge invariant content of a corresponding gauged WZNW theory.Toda
Hamiltonian reduction is achieved by imposing certain first class, conformally invari-
ant constraints on the KM currents, which reduce the chiral KM phase spaces to phase
spaces carrying the chiral W-algebras as their Poisson bracket structure [12,13].In fact, the Lax
potential of the effective field theory corresponding to this WZNW reduction coincides
with the Lax potential postulated by Leznov and Saveliev to set up their theory.Classically, the constrained WZNW theory has been defined as the usual WZNW
theory with its KM phase space reduced by the set of constraints given by (2.16), which
in the canonical variables read
?i = ?and ?˜ in (2.23),
and thus the corresponding effective field theory is invariant under the parity P1.The effective action of the reduced theory, (1.1), can also be obtained in a natural way,
by using the Lagrangean, gauged WZNW implementation of the Hamiltonian reduction
[13].The important point for us is that, as is easy to
see, in the A± = 0 gauge one recovers from (2.21) both the field equations (1.3) of the
WZNW theory and the constraints (2.16).This
means that the theory given by (4.12) can also be regarded as a reduction of their
theory.Lagrangean realization of the Hamiltonian reduction
We shall exhibit here a gauged WZNW theory providing the Lagrangean realization
of those Hamiltonian reductions of the WZNW theory which can be defined by imposing
15
first class constraints of the type (2.3) on the KM currents J and J˜ of the theory.It would be clearly worthwhile to
study in general the relationship between the generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierachies of
[48] and the WGS -algebras together with their further reductions, see also [16,17].

As far as we know this model has never before been investigated, so we
stray somewhat from the main subject of this paper and give some general details.Unfortunately this solution is incomplete, and in particular we fail to produce for
symmetric matrices any results generalizing the Virasoro constraints of sections 2
and 3.The constraints found here act directly on Y¯ , whereas in ref.The original motivation for the research that led to this paper was to find a
geometrical picture for unitary matrix models.Crnkovic´, M. Douglas, and G. Moore, “Loop equations and the topological
phase of multicritical matrix models,” Yale/Rutgers University preprint YCTP-
P25-91/RU-91-36 (August 1991).(On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly apparent that matrix models
involving an external matrix field possess a rich multicritical structure [6, 17].)Nevertheless, it has been instructive to
study this model for the subtleties it reveals in the hermitian and unitary matrix
models.The Virasoro constraints are a convenient starting point for extracting useful
information about the model.In this final section we discuss an interesting example of a model which can be
solved only partially by the methods we have been using: the real-symmetric matrix
model.There has recently been considerable progress in the study of matrix models,
following the remarkable proof by Kontsevich that the intersection numbers (correla-
tion functions) of two-dimensional topological gravity are generated by a new type of
matrix model [1].In the final section we discuss our results, and speculate what these might teach
us about unitary matrix integrals.8, 6,
is that of a unitary matrix,

?A short time later, Witten showed [2] that the partition function
of this model obeys the Virasoro constraints of the one-matrix model [3, 4], thus
completing the chain of arguments in a proof of the old conjecture that topological
gravity and matrix models are equivalent [5].It appears that
this model in an external field has not been looked at before, so we permit ourselves
to stray somewhat from the subject of Virasoro constraints and discuss this case in
a fair amount of detail.Now we conjecture that the unitary matrix model of section 3 is a third example
of this type.3, 4, corresponding to perturbations about the
m = 1 “topological” point of the one-matrix model.In this paper we have demonstrated an efficient method of deriving Virasoro con-
straints satisfied by the Kontsevich model, which we generalized to the unitary matrix
model (3.1).As a possible generalization of this work, one could try to extend these results
to the d = ?2 external field model [17].Joseph Henry Laboratories, Department of Physics,

Prefitem
Following the discovery of the Jones invariants in knot theory there has been
renewed interest in trying to find new invariants associated with knots, graphs
and 3–manifolds.This suggests
that any graph with vanishing character can be interpreted as a triangulation of
3–manifold and has IG as its invariant.When two tetra-
hedra with colors (a, b, c, d, e, f) and (a, b, c, l,m, n) are glued along their common
face with colors (a, b, c), the graphs representing them are joined together such
that the common area and the lines will have the same colors as shown in figure
3.We illustrate the above procedures for a simple case of two tetrahedra glued
together as in figure 5a.Thus
we obtain IG, an invariant of a given graph with vanishing character.The sum in equation (10) , denoted by 14?p,r, r = k + 2 can be evaluated as
follows.The problem which we
consider is this : can we modify the RHS of (2) so that the tetrahedral symme-
tries are present and it represents an invariant of the graph G i.e.This process
of reducing by symmetry transformations the original graph to a set of standard
simple objects whose invariants can be evaluated easily is quite akin to the skein
relations in calculating the usual graph invariants.The
graph invariant IS3 (which is the same as TV invariant) for S3 can be evaluated
easily using the Reidemeister moves and the result is
IS3 = S200.Figure 8 : Triangulation of Lp,q (subscripts for ?This problem can be fixed, while preserving the tetrahedral
symmetry, by associating a factor (?1)2j S0j
S00
with each line or region colored j and
by requiring the graph to have vanishing character.However this solution will not have the required tetrahedral symmetry
and will lead to a modified prescription for the graph invariant.For the case of
3–manifolds it is known that any two triangulations describe the same manifold
if these two are connected by a finite number of (k, l) moves and their inverses
where k + l = 5 [8] .

04 Partition Functions and Topology-Changing Amplitudes
We have found that the Hartle-Hawking-type wave-functions in the lattice gravity and
the Chern-Simons theory are related by the isomorphism (14) between the physical Hilbert
spaces of the two theories.The recent studies on two-dimensional gravity are mostly based on
this approach[3].Based on this observation, Ponzano and Regge defined a partition function ZM for the
manifold M by

isomorphism (14) preserves the inner products in the two Hilbert spaces, HCS and H(?).Such a wave-
function may be regarded as a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking wave-function (The

In the lattice gravity of Ponzano and Regge, one can define a discretized verion of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation which characterizes physical states in the theory.When its
end-points meet with each other, the Wilson-line can be replace by an identity.

The new stress tensor Tˆ (z) satisfies the Virasoro algebra with a vanishing central charge.Higher-Rank Supersymmetry
The close resemblance between the N = 2 minimal model and the SU(2) WZNW
model has been well recognized.Since the stress tensor takes the BRST
exact form (4.3), correlators of the basic physical operators are independent of their world
sheet positions, and hence there is no notion of distance in the theory.The physical states in our topological theory are realized as the non-vanishing BRST
cohomology.In sect.3 we show that the original idea of the chirality
in N = 2 theory can be extended in our model.The first step is to twist the model through the redefi-
nition of the stress tensor

We have seen that our higher-rank supersymmetric model is a fairly natural exten-
sion of the N = 2 minimal model and its topological version possesses all the properties
characteristic to TCFT.Introduction
The twisting of the N = 2 minimal superconformal model [1] gives rise to a funda-
mental class of topological field theories [2].

For a finite ?e, all the terms beyond the quadratic are irrelevant in the limit ? ??
because they are suppressed by powers of ?. This demonstrates the universality of
the continuum limit: any potential possessing a quadratic maximum will yield the
same sum over continuous surfaces. In effect, our rescaling has swept all the non-
universal details of the potential out to infinity. This implies, for instance, that,
instead of working with the potential of fig. 2, we can use the double well potential
U(?) = ?12?2+ ?4 (fig. 3). After rescaling
?
?? = y, the Schro¨dinger equation again
reduces to the motion in the inverted harmonic oscillator. The only difference is that
now fermions fill both sides of the maximum. To all orders of the WKB expansion
this simply multiplies the density of states, and therefore the free energy, by a factor
of 2. The double well potential does not suffer from the non-perturbative instabilities:
the ground state energy can in principle be calculated even for finite N and ?. We
will often adopt the symmetric case because it is more convenient for calculations,
remembering that we have to divide by 2 to find the sum over triangulated surfaces.

From eq. (3.21) we know the sum over all surfaces of spherical topology embedded
in R1. In order to find the sums over surfaces of any topology, we need to develop a
systematic WKB expansion of the ground state energy. According to eqs. (3.18) and
(3.19), all we need to know is the complete expansion of the single particle density of
states ?(µ). If we consider µ such that ?µ is O(1), then this problem has a remarkably
simple solution,5 because eq. (3.22) shows that in this energy range the system is
purely quadratic. Let us write the density of states as

It is of some interest to compare the approach which as been used recently in CFT and
in 2D integrable models. a) Rational conformal field theories are invariant under chiral
vertex operator algebras, which could be local, e.g. the Virasoro or affine algebras, or
non-local, e.g. the parafermionic algebras. The conformal field theories are reformulated
as representation theories of the chiral algebras: Hilbert spaces of the CFT’s are direct
sums of representations of the chiral algebras; conformal primary fields are intertwiners for
the chiral algebras, etc... The chiral algebras are non-abelian and this is, for a large part,
at the origin of the exact solvability of the CFT’s. Being completely integrable, the CFT’s
also possess infinitely many local integrals of motion in involution. However, almost none
of these integrals of motion are actually used to solve the conformal models. (It is even
difficult to express them in terms the generators of the chiral algebras.) b) In contrast, a

An O(d, d) symmetry of the manifold of string vacua that do not depend on d (out
of D) space-time coordinates has been recently identified. Here we write down, for d =
D ? 1, the low energy equations of motion and their general solution in a manifestly
O(d, d)-invariant form, pointing out an amusing similarity with the renormalization group
framework. Previously considered cosmological and black hole solutions are recovered as
particular examples.

find a gauge-fixed quantum action which is free. The structure of the BRST charge

prove that critical and subcritical N = 2 string theory gives a realization of
an N = 2 superfield extension of the topological conformal algebra. The essential
observation is the vanishing of the background ghost charge. The N = 2
superstring introduced by Ademollo et. al. [1,2,3,4,5] has the critical dimension
2, there are no transverse degrees of freedom, the physical spectrum contains a
finite number of particles, all massless and bosonic. There is a general belief that
this is topological quantum theory. In this note we will prove that critical and

originally intended to give a talk on homological reduction of first class
constrained Hamiltonian systems, as in my joint work with Henneaux, Fisch and
Teitelboim [FHST]. Since the organizers have given me the ?honor? of opening
the conference, I will attempt to set that work in a larger context, namely that of
ghost techniques in mathematical physics.
What are ‘ghosts’ and what are they doing in physics? The name reflects the fact
that they are new, auxiliary variables that are NOT physical, but are added to the
system for computational reasons. An analogy familiar to many mathematicians
is that of a resolution in homological algebra - the generators added to construct
the resolution are the analogs of ghosts. Indeed it is more than an analogy in some
cases; I first became seriously interested in the subject when I read a preprint of
Browning and McMullan [BM] in which certain ‘anti-ghosts’ were clearly identified
as generators of the Koszul resolution of an appropriate ideal.
But I am getting ahead of my story, both conceptually and historically. My
intention this morning is to set the stage for a set of techniques and results which
can be grouped under the rubric of ‘cohomological physics’, particularly BRST
cohomology.
It will be easier to illustrate why BRST cohomology is of interest than it will
be to say what it is. The acronym BRST has come to be applied in mathematical
physics very widely; at times one gets the feeling it could be applied any time one
has an operator of square zero (called in physics ‘nilpotence’), but I will try to hold
back the sea and restrict the term somewhat.

Present state of the study of nonlinear “integrable” systems related
to the group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on various surfaces is overviewed.
Roles of area-preserving diffeomorphisms in 4-d self-dual gravity are reviewed. Re-
cent progress in new members of this family, the SDiff(2) KP and Toda hierarchies,
is reported. The group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on a cylinder plays a
key role just as the infinite matrix group GL(?) does in the ordinary KP and Toda
lattice hierarchies. The notion of tau functions is also shown to persist in these
hierarchies, and gives rise to a central extension of the corresponding Lie algebra.Present state of the study of nonlinear “integrable” systems related

hierarchies, and gives rise to a central extension of the corresponding Lie algebra.Present state of the study of nonlinear “integrable” systems related
to the group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on various surfaces is overviewed.
Roles of area-preserving diffeomorphisms in 4-d self-dual gravity are reviewed. Re-
cent progress in new members of this family, the SDiff(2) KP and Toda hierarchies,
is reported. The group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on a cylinder plays a
key role just as the infinite matrix group GL(?) does in the ordinary KP and Toda
lattice hierarchies. The notion of tau functions is also shown to persist in these
hierarchies, and gives rise to a central extension of the corresponding Lie algebra.

An analogue of the KP hierarchy, the SDiff(2) KP hierarchy, related to the group of
area-preserving diffeomorphisms on a cylinder is proposed. An improved Lax formalism
of the KP hierarchy is shown to give a prototype of this new hierarchy. Two important
potentials, S and ? , are introduced. The latter is a counterpart of the tau function of
the ordinary KP hierarchy. A Riemann-Hilbert problem relative to the group of area-
diffeomorphisms gives a twistor theoretical description (nonlinear graviton construction)
of general solutions. A special family of solutions related to topological minimal models
are identified in the framework of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. Further, infinitesimal
symmetries of the hierarchy are constructed. At the level of the tau function, these
symmetries obey anomalous commutation relations, hence leads to a central extension of
the algebra of infinitesimal area-preserving diffeomorphisms (or of the associated Poisson
algebra).

the transformations generated by the g2’s is in fact equivalent to tune the time

it is just this symmetry that leads to the integrability of the discrete linear system.
