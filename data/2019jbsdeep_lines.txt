Introduction
Conclusive association entities (CAEs) in a biomedical
article a are those biomedical entities (e.g., genes, dis-
eases, and chemicals) that are specifically involved in the
associations concluded in a.Ranking of entities
We model CAE identification as an entity ranking task,
which aims at prioritizing candidate entities so that

CAEs in an article can be ranked on the top.Those entities that are ranked on
the top in an article are likely to be entities of the associa-
tions reported in the article.Identification of
CAEs among candidate entities in the title and the abstract of an article is essential for curation and exploration of
conclusive findings in biomedical literature.CAEs of an article a are
the specific entities involved in the associations that CTD experts
curated based on the conclusive findings of a.

Abstract
Background: VerbNet, an extensive computational verb lexicon for English, has proved useful for supporting a
wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks requiring information about the behaviour and meaning of verbs.Biomedical text processing and mining could benefit from a similar resource.The resulting classification provides 1149 verbs
assigned to the 50 classes in the original resource.
Conclusions
We developed and validated a Cardiac-centered Frailty
Ontology.By cre-
ating implementation rules, we were able to demonstrate
that the Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology covered the
topics used in the instruments.Frailty terms from the
Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology and from a prior
study [46] were used.The Cardiac-centered Frailty Ontology reflects general
frailty assessment as implemented in the frailty instruments
used in its development [2, 48–58].Figure 1 shows the top concepts in our Cardiac-centered
Frailty Ontology.

motivation for applying a spatio-structural frame of ref-
erence lies in inventorying what is given in a particular
point in time by focusing on the spatio-structural prop-
erties of a given entity (spatio-structural perspective
[77]).As a consequence, there is an increasing need for an integrated system of hierarchies of
levels of different types of material entities that helps with organizing, structuring and integrating data from
disparate sources to facilitate data exploration, data comparison and analysis.This framework can
be used for intuitively structuring data in the life sciences, facilitating data exploration, and it can be employed for
reasoning over different granularity levels across different hierarchies.

Background
Social risk factors are important dimensions of health and
are linked to access to care, quality of life, health out-
comes, life expectancy and health care utilization.For example, to process the
sentence “patient has to stay at the VA hospital overnight
because he had no one to take him home after the proce-
dure” requires identification of everyday words, tasks, and
roles, in addition to inference capabilities to arrive at the
(correct) conclusion that the patient lacks social support.The use case to which we applied Moonstone for this

final step, all values of the structured data items were
analyzed by A-Z analysis for implausible data.Figure 2 shows the
designed structure, and Table 1 shows a sample data
set.Conclusions: We showed that systematic analysis of free-text-containing medical records is possible with standard
tools.Semantic evaluation of
such data requires the data to be encoded with sufficient classifications or transformed into a knowledge-based

Background
The launching of a working group on the “use of elec-
tronic medical records for clinical research” [1] in 2011
by the GMDS (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Medizinische
Informatik, Biometrie und Epidemiologie) is evidence of
the enormous importance of medical records for re-
search; however, it also underlines the difficulties that
arise when trying to analyze these data.
For example, the IRR measured using Gwet’s AC2 coefficients improved from 0.545 in the first session to 0.910 in the
last one, that is, the annotators’ evaluations were much more homogeneous at the end of the consensus sessions
Lithgow-Serrano et al.We also compared the IRR between all combinations of
annotators’ pairs as a way of detecting consistent bias of
one annotator versus the others (see Fig.It depends
on the personal context, and we could confirm the impor-
tance of guidelines and consensus sessions to homogenize,
at a certain grade, the annotators performance.+ var() (3)
Kendall’s coefficient is an associationmeasure that quan-
tifies the degree of agreement among annotators based on
Lithgow-Serrano et al.This train-
ing period was considered concluded when a minimum
annotator interagreement was achieved or the annota-
tors considered that they fully understood the annotation
guidelines.
This enables us to change the behaviour of
the corpus builder by changing the underlying ontology
instead of changing the software.The definition of the improved MODE or NEAR (e.g.,
NEAR/S) operators (columns: “MODE” and “NEAR”) is
possible for both, composite terms and multiple concept
queries.The search for complica-
tions in the usage of medical devices within the post-
market surveillance or the classification of the incident
reports are only two examples in this area.For
commercial use (in our case post-market surveillance
purposes for medical devices), ontologies are rather dy-
namic constructs with a constant pace of re-editing to
react upon changing search parameters.This feature fosters transparency of a systematic search
and repeatability, which is a legal imperative in the post-
market surveillance of medical devices.
Keywords: Medication, Annotation, Prescriptions, Modeling
Background
Patient medication regimens are described in a variety of
genres of medical documents, including prescription or-
ders, intake interview medication lists, discharge sum-
maries, prescribing guidelines, and medication orders.PredMed [17] and MedXN [18] are two more recent
systems which improve on the accuracy demonstrated
by the 2009 i2b2 challenge entries.The TranScriptML schema
implementation, manual annotation, and machine learning were all performed using the MITRE Annotation Toolkit
(MAT).In this paper, we describe the annotation schema, the curation
of a corpus of prescription instructions through a manual annotation effort, and initial experiments in modeling and
automated generation of TranScriptML representations.MedLEE, a
commercial system developed to extract various med-
ical concepts, identifies medication names but not dos-
age attributes.
Efficiently managing and
organizing data has become key to data exploration and
eScience, and developing adequate data and metadata stan-
dards is becoming increasingly important [3–5].Morphological data remain the primary data source for
© The Author(s).The use of such named graph resources allows meaningful fragmentation of
the data, which in turn enables subsequent specification of all kinds of data views for managing and accessing
morphological data.As a consequence,
interpreting and analyzing morphological data becomes
unnecessarily difficult for non-experts and integrating
morphological data with other sources of data in the life
sciences very difficult and time-consuming.In the last decade, progress has been made in semantic-
ally representing phenotypic data.
Using a unifying ontology for organization
at the pathway level will ameliorate the first two of these
challenges.Our methods can be used to reduce the manual effort
associated with ontology curation, and more broadly, for augmenting the curators’ ability to organize and integrate
data from pathway databases using the Pathway Ontology.By organizing
pathways from different databases under a single unify-
ing ontology, we can understand how pathway data from
different databases relate to one another.tA?B idf (t)

Our goal is to associate pathway instances from various
databases to the correct class in the Pathway Ontology.
The Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP) was created to support such
annotation.Results: We define standards for an OMP-based annotation framework that supports the capture of a variety of
phenotypes and provides flexibility for different levels of detail based on a combination of pre- and post-
composition using OMP and other Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) projects.Keywords: Annotation, Phenotypes, Ontology, Biomedical ontologies, Curation, Microbial phenotypes, Microbial

Background
Phenotypes are the result of the interaction of a particular
genotype with an environment.The Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP) [5] was
created for the systematic annotation of the phenotypes of
microbes (e.g.To
capture these relative phenotypes in OMP, we have cre-
ated special virtual strains that represent the average be-
havior of the particular collection of mutants used in a
particular study.
It is based on the Unstructured Infor-
mation Management Architecture (UIMA) framework
and the OpenNLP toolkit [13].Conclusion: DIRECT can detect oncology concepts and attribute relationships with high precision and can detect
recurrence with significant increase in F1-score, compared to the original implementation of cTAKES, due to the
usage of a custom dictionary and a generic concept relationship detection algorithm.The performance of the four
implementations was compared with a two-tailed permutation test.Journal of Biomedical Semantics           (2019) 10:14 Page 2 of 13

same pathogen may cause different types of diseases (e.g.,
depending on the anatomical site of infection).
Here, in analogy to the case of
quality assignments (modeling relations indexed with
time points), we have decided to follow the presential
pattern and we have used the reification pattern to
model time-extended relations.The goal is the reconstruction of cell migration patterns, shape and state changes, and, comprehensive
genealogical information from these data.Especially
in cases where temporal slices are tangible objects (as in
cell tracking experiments), the number of reified entities
is lower and the reified presentials are well-grounded
domain concepts, which in turn increases the adequate-
ness of the model.Abbreviations

The paper was presented at the Workshop on Ontologies and Data in Life
Sciences (ODLS) 2014 in Freiburg.In that sense, a model presenting temporal non-
overlapping slices of a cell can be easily reformulated
with the help of state modeling:
In contrast to the previous model, the new model does
not use the notion of time slices, which requires a 4-d
interpretation of entities.

identify misspelt names of drugs, overcoming the loss of
information inherit from using either exact match search
methods or string based similarity search.Some of the directions in which this work can be
extended include: a) adapting the phonetic matching pro-
cess originally designed to the Portuguese language to be
used over large corpora in different languages, such as
English; b) integrating our method in a framework for
Medical Records Information Extraction applications to
address the problem of generically dealing with spelling
errors in the information extraction process beyond
names of drugs, including other types of clinical variables,
such as symptoms and diagnoses; c) exploring the use of
machine learning methods to optimally and dynamically
tune the threshold parameters and disambiguating mis-
spelt candidates in cases when they are similar to more
than one medication; d) comparing the proposed solution
with other approximate string match approaches.
Recently, the Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP) was funded by the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute to develop an integrated open access database (known as BREATH) to characterize the
molecular and cellular anatomy of the developing lung.Design of the ontology framework for the mouse lung
A review of existing anatomic ontologies for the mouse,
including UBERON, MA and EMAP, demonstrated that
these ontologies had limited coverage of the fetal and
postnatal mouse lung, especially for the later stages of
lung development when alveolar growth, vascularization,
septation, and maturation are initiated.Likewise, a de-
tailed anatomic ontology for the late fetal and postnatal
human lung was constructed and then harmonized with
the mouse ontology in order to compare normal devel-
opmental processes between the two species.Recently, a cooperative research project, the Molecular
Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP), was
initiated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute to characterize and compare the molecular anatomy
of mouse and human lungs, focusing on the later stages
of lung development and maturation [45, 46].LungMAP

Open-ended questionnaire
Questionnaire development
We developed an open–ended questionnaire to capture
patients’ opinions about all aspects relevant to assessing
the management of their knee condition while minimising
the number and complexity of questions.Addressing this aim required us
to: (1) develop an open–ended questionnaire, (2) collect
responses to the questionnaire, (3) analyse the responses
manually to establish the ground truth, (4) develop text
mining methods to analyse the responses automatically,
and (5) evaluate the performance of the text mining
methods.KLOG
compresses them into a single open–ended question:
“Can you describe any knee pain you have experienced
over the past week?” To illustrate a greater coverage of the
open-ended question, we provide a sample of answers:

the Ontology of Host-Microbiome Interactions

terms in these specific areas, which are important foci
of current microbiome research, but also to provide a

generated to represent typical host-microbiome interaction studies.Keywords: Microbiome, Host-microbiome interaction, Ontology, Ontology of host-microbiome interactions, OHMI,

A microbiome is defined as a community of microbes
(for example, bacteria) found in a particular habitat (for
example, a human host) [1–3].An OHMI:host is then an organism that
bears a host role in relation to some microbiome.
