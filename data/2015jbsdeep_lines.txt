The in-
clusion of these keywords significantly increases our
coverage in literature mining.It is noted that many keywords
(e.g., by, when, source, products, necessary, through)
listed in the BioNLP’09 Shared Task training data are
not considered as interaction keywords in INO.A network is a
process that includes at least two connected interactions.Therefore, the under-
represented ‘cleavage reaction’ indicates that the whole
category of cleavage reaction is under-represented al-
though the above three specific reaction types are over-
represented.It is likely that some of these under-
represented interactions represent new research oppor-
tunities in the vaccinology domain.

Background: As the availability of open access full text research articles increases, so does the need for
sophisticated search services that make the most of this new content.There are a few free-to-use services that provide bio-
medical literature search services on full-text documents,
for example, PubMed Central (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
This work is also partially supported
by the Medical Research Council (Supporting Evidence-based Public Health
Interventions using Text Mining [Grant MR/L01078X/1]) and by the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (Big Mechanism [Grant DARPA-BAA-14-
14]).After considering their ad-
vice, we decided to utilise scientific articles from various
COPD-relevant journals, rather than build a corpus of
clinical records which are highly US-specific.The first branch performs joint anno-
tation of concepts pertaining to Problem, Treatment and
TestOrMeasure by means of the NERsuite [45] compo-
nent, a named entity recogniser (NER) based on an imple-
mentation of conditional random fields [46].In our previous publication [5] on which this work
is built upon, we proposed to form a corpus of clinical
records from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring
in Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) Clinical Database [6,7].The effort we have undertaken, in con-
trast, can be considered as a step towards automating
such EQ model-based fine-grained annotation of pheno-
typic information.
Performance drops to its lowest for
terms that have information content between 7 and 9
indicating there still remains much work to be done to
accurately predict these specific and informative terms.c)Macro-averaged F-measure
performance binned by GO term information content.The first would be to incorporate larger spans for a bag-
of-words model due to the surprising performance of the
non-sentence co-mentions.It is probable that if we
normalized protein mentions to specific species or imple-
mented a cross-species evaluation utilizing homology the
results of the enhanced dictionary would show improved
performance.While a rela-
tionship may exist between the annotated GO category
and another exact mention of the labeled protein, that
would be considered incorrect for the purposes of this
annotation, i.e., it is a decision relative to individual men-
tions of the protein in a specific textual context.

large-scale gene targeted knockout screens have been
designed to analyze the phenotypic consequences of mu-
tating each protein-coding gene in mouse (International
Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, IMPC) [2].MGI will remain the source of global mouse phenotype

tributions and literature.Keywords: Phenotype, Ontology, Mouse, Data integration, DatabaseBackground

by augmenting the pharmacologic classes with necessary
and sufficient conditions, we found that we could inferntral.In comparison to older methods of knowledge represen-
tation, DL ensures common, unambiguous semantics so
that the ontology’s interpretation is consistent across
software and users.

Background: We develop medical-specialty specific ontologies that contain the settled science and common

Second, we have demonstrated the fit of the seman-
tic statistics vocabularies to enrich the CDISC ODM data
model for the publication of clinical study data as linked
data.Observational clinical study data is patchy by nature,
mainly because of the various collection mechanisms
involved that often lead to information being inadver-
tently left out or inaccurately recorded.This paper explores the integration of clinical study data exchange standards and semantic
statistic vocabularies to deliver clinical data as linked data in a format that is easier to enrich with links to
complementary data sources and consume by a broad user base.Phase 1: Integrating the CDISC ODM data model with the

Bank.After mapping of the clinical drugs to ingredi-
ents, there were 45.2 million pairs of co-prescribed
drugs, ranging in frequency between 1 and 158,515 (me-

the panel based on a number of factors, including sever-

A relevant example of such collab-
orative knowledge curation is the development of the
International Classification of Disorders (ICD-11) [10], or
efforts like the Gene Ontology [11], the Human Pheno-
type Ontology [12] or the International Classification for
Nursing Practice (ICNP) [13].The individual nature of this effort leads to the need of a mechanism
to enable us to create an overarching and comprehensive overview of the different perspectives on the domain
knowledge.The community-driven ontology curation process, however, ignores the possibility
of multiple communities building, in parallel, conceptualisations of the same domain, and thus providing slightly
different perspectives on the same knowledge.This novel aspect of
our work brings several benefits, which are discussed later
in the paper.For example, they can
be used to model and capture knowledge around a par-
ticular set of hereditary disorders (e.g., bone dysplasias),
in addition to their underlying genetic mechanisms (relat-
ing disorders to genes) and their observable traits (relating
disorders to phenotypes).
Here is an
example of the elimination rule for concepts: if a concept
is more general or equivalent to one of the other concepts
in the definition of the same concept or a superconcept.For example, Figure 1 depicts a series of steps, com-
prising the annotation of the sentence with concepts from
a designated ontology, the representation of this textual
definition in a feature space and the application of a
trained model, e.g., classifier, that has learned to recog-
nize roles (relations) between biomedical concepts, can
lead to the final desired output, which is the formal defini-
tion of “Baritosis”.For example, in
Table 4 Examples of highly weighted lexical features for
the three SNOMED CT roles: AM Associated_morphology
CA (Causative_agent), and FS (Finding_site)
AM “displacement of”, “medical condition characterized”
CA “caused”, “cause”, “from the”, “by a”, “agent of”, “an infection of”
FS “of”, “in”, “affects only”, “infection of”
Table 4, we have the SNOMED CT concepts
Baritosis_(disorder) whose type is disorder and
Barium_Dust_(substance) having type substance.However, this does not affect the
definition, since we have ?Causative_agent.Barium_dust,
Petrova et al.Thus, we formulate the problem tar-
geted by the present work as follows: create a system, that
for a given set of input texts annotated with biomedical
concepts is able: (a) to find text strings that describe a rela-
tionship between these concepts, and to recognize, which
relationship it is, and (b) to combine these relationship
instances into concept definitions.
However, because the knowledge-base is intended for
patient use, it will be essential to determine the
appropriate since the aforementioned third party
ontologies utilize professional vocabulary which may
not be understood by patients.Statement 2 alludes to the left branch with an

model parameters:
• SVMRank: a value of 30 for the trade-off between

• ListNet: 1500 epochs and a learning rate of 0.00001;
Feature blocks FB3 and FB5 were not found to improve
performance in these experiments.We have considered two
strategies: (i) a union strategy, where the individual anno-
tations of all top-K ranked systems are merged via a set
union, and the union is considered the final classification
result on that particular instance; and (ii) an oracle strat-
egy, where using the ground truth, we aim to choose the
single system among the top-K ranked that maximises the
performance metric.Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2015) 6:24 Page 12 of 12

Background
New biomedical data is increasingly housed in resource
description framework (RDF) triple stores such as
Virtuoso [1] and AllegroGraph [2], annotated using rich
ontology schemas and queried using an RDF query lan-
guage called SPARQL [3].To promote ease of
querying, systems that utilize ontology-based RDF data
have experimented with various interfaces: iSparql [8],
NITELIGHT [9] and BioSPARQL [10] facilitate for-
mulating SPARQL queries by allowing the biomedical
scientists to browse ontology concepts and pinpoint a sub-
graph that pertains to the question in his or her mind.Words and phrases relevant to
the domain and of import to understanding the question
are deemed as important entities and extracted from the
processed question by utilizing entity recognition tech-
niques.Let CO denote
this set from ontology, O.4 OntoNLQA is a general framework and its realization in the context of our driving biological problem is called AskCuebee
Asiaee et al.
The relationships between the terms in SO provide for
the annotation of multi-part features such as gene
models, composed of multiple transcripts, exons, introns
and UTR features.Capturing the effect of a sequence alter-
ation on the genomic features with which it intersects is
an important step towards understanding the implication
of the variant sequence.Under the sequence vari-
ant node, SO provides two high level nodes in the ontol-
ogy: structural variant and functional variant.How-
ever, knowing the type and genomic location of a se-
quence change is just the first step in understanding its
clinical or biological consequences.The Genome Variation Format (GVF) [13] is a variant
file format for the detailed annotation of genetic vari-
ation.

X–ray or MRI) are usually accompanied by imaging re-
ports (or radiology reports), which serve the purpose of
conveying a specialist interpretation of images and relate
it to the patient’s signs and symptoms in order to suggest
diagnosis [8].The
review highlighted the fact that a range of studies have
proven the feasibility of NLP for extracting structured
information from free text reports (e.g.Methods: As an ontology–driven information extraction system, KneeTex makes active use of an ontology to strongly
guide and constrain text analysis.For example, the knowledge about knee anatomy,
which is cross–referenced to a total of 205 concepts in the
Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) [37], is directly
applicable to interpretation of reports describing knee
MRI scans.This knowledge resource allowed
us to implement an NLP system able to interpret knee–re-
lated clinical findings from MRI reports.
In future versions, we will
provide a Java API.During the last decade, many open-source libraries
useful for working with OWL ontologies written in RDF
+XML format have become available.These, however,
fail to fully meet the needs of software developers build-
ing software for working with OWL ontologies.The resulting library, owlcpp, is designed to sup-
port a common workflow where OWL ontologies
written in RDF/XML are loaded from the file system
and submitted to a reasoner for processing (Fig.owlcpp and Redland are natively-compiled li-
braries, whereas Jena and OWL API run under Java
virtual machine and exhibit less deterministic perform-
ance and memory footprint due to just-in-time compil-

ant to researchers to promote their research activities.
Themultiplicity of a unique type link describes the num-
ber of instances connected to each other.When
considering the full resource, all type links <:Gene, :locate-
dOn, :Chromosome> correspond to the same unique type
link.For
the triple <:BRCA1, :locatedOn, :chromosome17> the
type link is <:Gene, :locatedOn, :Chromosome>.In the triple <:Adam :hasSon :Bob> the type link is

The special issue on bio-ontologies and phenotypes in-
cludes selected papers that were presented at the Bio-
Ontologies SIG and the Phenotype Day at ISMB (Intelli-
gent Systems for Molecular Biology) conference in 2014.
The working area A was imple-
mented in such a way that only the subtree of
_ELEMENT is displayed for the user, whereas the
subtree of _CONFIG remains hidden.The TO includes at the upmost level following
classes: _CONFIG, _ELEMENT, and _ANNOTATING_
ONTOLOGY_ROOT.The main difference between the
ObTiMa’s Trial Builder and the OSE consists in that the
Trial Builder is based on ODM and the possible item
attributes (e.g., question, data type, measurement unit) are
fixed and cannot be changed or extended, whereas in OSE
item attributes are defined by domain ontologies and
can be flexibly handled.1 Ontological architecture

same class of the same annotating ontology establishes a
semantic connection between these instances.
