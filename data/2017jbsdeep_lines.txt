It would be an asset for biomedical ontologies to be able to support such a probabilistic reasoning
and formalize Bayesian indicators of performance: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative
predictive value.Thus, the prevalence value
can be identified to the objective probability assigned
to the disposition dPrevg,M .To solve this problem, we will formalize the real IP
value as the probability assigned to a disposition borne by
an instance of group of individuals; and estimates of IPs as
data items which are about such a disposition.This group g1 will be formalized as a collection of
humans (for more on collections, see [18]).Keywords: Sensitivity, Specificity, Medical test, Spectrum effect, Disposition, Realist ontology, Informational entity
Background
Definition of indicators of performance
Biomedical ontologies aim at providing the most exhaust-
ive and rigorous representation of reality as described by
biomedical sciences.
Therefore
these relations may be a poor fit to clinical drug ontology
use cases.However, this fea-
ture may facilitate clustering of drug-indication relationsand so explain WHO-ATC’s wide acceptance as a stand-
ard for drug classification and discovery research.Keywords: Drug indications, Drug-disease relations, Drug ontologies, Drug information integration, UMLS, WHO-ATCBackground
Biomedical information overload and the potential of
formal ontologies to help overcome it are well recog-
nized [1–3].Conclusions: The DID is a database of structured drug-indication relations intended to facilitate building practical,
comprehensive, integrated drug ontologies.Drug-disease relations, specifically
drug-indication relations, are a prime candidate for representation in ontologies.
For this pur-
pose we developed an automated system which gathers

all approaches are much smaller than the relative size
of the raw data dump.Given that the indexes of
HiBISCuS, SPLENDID and SAFE remain quite small rel-
ative to total data sizes, they can easily be loaded into
memory, where lookups can be performed in millisec-
onds.
As no morphological axis is available
within the NCIt, we have adapted the NCIt by adding
concepts corresponding to ICD-O-3morphologies, which
we related to the corresponding diagnoses (based on the
ICD-O-3 annotation of the NCIt).A total of 20133 (0.27%) expressions sub-
suming at least one NCIt code were identified and the
corresponding classes were introduced in the model as
diagnoses.During the building pro-
cess, a significant part of NCIt concepts was retrieved as
subclasses of multiple diagnosis classes.The NCIt structure and the available relationships can help to bridge disease
classifications taking into account their structural and granular heterogeneities.The NCIt structure and the available relationships

The Drug Ontology (DrOn) is a Web Ontology Language

Elements of
the Linked Data paradigm facilitate the systematic and scalable integration of relevant evidence sources.Evidence “linkouts” – the bridge between the summary
and “drill down” use cases
An important data element in the drug_hoi_evidence
table is the evidence_linkout column.LAERTES provides open and
scalable architecture for linking evidence sources relevant
to investigating the association of drugs with HOIs.Data are aggregated from the evidence items
and inserted into this table during the evidence load
process using queries against the tables shown in Fig.Results: LAERTES provides a standardized, open, and scalable architecture for linking evidence sources relevant to
the association of drugs with health outcomes of interest (HOIs).
Using VO,
INO, and normalized E. coli gene names, we applied an ontology-based SciMiner literature mining strategy to
mine all PubMed abstracts and retrieve E. coli vaccine-associated E. coli gene interactions.Fourth, we further demonstrated that the
centrality-based analysis enhanced our ability in identi-
fying hub or critical genes or nodes in the E. coli gene-
vaccine intearction network.Given so
many E. coli strains and different E. coli usages, it has been
a challenge in mining vaccine-related E. coli gene interac-
tions from the large pool of literature reports.Conclusions: Vaccine-related E. coli gene-gene interaction network was constructed using ontology-based literature
mining strategy, which identified important E. coli vaccine genes and their interactions with other genes through
specific interaction types.These E. coli gene names, vaccine
names, vaccine genes, and interaction keywords were
then combinatorially used by SciMiner to process all
PubMed abstracts to construct a vaccine-related E. coli

As mentioned before, MeSH Now was developed in
2014 based on the learning-to-rank framework we first
proposed in 2010 [3] for automatic MeSH indexing.Thus there are many outdated MeSH
Fig.The rationale for Formula
(1) is that if the (i + 1)th MeSH term was assigned with a
score much smaller than the ith MeSH term, the MeSH
terms ranked lower than i would not be considered rele-
vant to the target article.Like many manual annotation projects [26–30],
MeSH indexing is a labour-intensive process.Next,
we apply a learning-to-rank algorithm to sort the candi-
date MeSH terms based on the learned associations be-
tween the document text and each candidate MeSH
term.

The second implication is that we gained new insights
on how the ISO 11179 standard could interact with the
CIMI Reference Model for supporting detailed clinical
modeling.A BCR data dictionary has been produced
using the standard CDEs from NCI caDSR.Several Semantic Web-based representations of the
ISO 11179 Part 3 meta-model have been created for pro-
jects including the XMDR project [16], Semantic MDR
in a European SALUS project [17] and CDISC2RDF in
FDA PhUSE Semantic Technology project [18].The repository covers all 38
clinical cancer study domains, comprising 316 distinct
object classes, 4719 distinct properties, 1015 non-
enumerated value domains and 1795 enumerated value
domains (i.e., value sets).We created a JAVA program that pro-
duces an OWL rendering of the CIMI Reference Model
using the UML2OWL mappings specified by the Object
Management Group (OMG) Ontology Definition meta-
model (ODM) standard [22].

Kafkas et al.Although we reduce a very high level of ambiguity by
applying the dictionary refinement process before text
mining the documents, some target and disease name
abbreviations could still be ambiguous with some other
names.The evidence includes common disease genetic evidence

rare Mendelian disease evidence based on ClinVar [3]
clinical variant information from EVA and text mined
target-disease associations from the Europe PMC
(https://europepmc.org/) literature database [4] (see Table 3
for a complete list of evidence types).The confidence score of a given document
represents how valuable the document is in the scope of target validation for a given target-disease association by
taking into account the credibility of the association based on the properties of the text.The data providers of the platform are asked to
ground their target and disease entities in to these refer-
ence resources so as to integrate the evidence in the
platform.
Ontology Recommender 1.0 sometimes suggests
ontologies with high specialization scores but with
very low input coverage, which makes the ontologies
inappropriate for the user’s input.This is an expected result,
given that the recommendation approach used by
Ontology Recommender 1.0 is based on the relation
between the number of annotations provided by each
ontology and its size, which is our measure for
ontology specialization.Suppose that a researcher needs to find the
best ontologies for a list of biomedical terms.Ontology Recommender 2.0 recommends over 500 biomedical ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal
platform, where it is openly available (both via the user interface at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/recommender,
and via a Web service API).This approach
has been implemented as release 2.0 of the NCBO
Ontology Recommender, a system that is able to find
the best ontologies for a biomedical text or set of
keywords.
Trial integration In order to assess the feasibility of
the above approach, we conducted a trial integration of
some examples taken from the three-level ontology of
abnormal states, the disease ontology, and some typical
external resources, in which we used 386 abnormal
states consisting of 279 abnormal states that are super
classes of 107 states that are the bottom level classes
appearing in 12 typical diseases from three medical spe-
cializations, i.e., cardiovascular medicine, neurology, and
gastroenterology.Keywords: Disease ontology, Definition of diseases, River flow model of disease, Linked data, Navigation system
Background
Recently, medical information resources that store consid-
erable amount of data have become available.General disease chains
are represented as an aggregation of the definitions of
abnormal states.1554 diseases and 7080 abnormal states in six major clinical areas, which are
extracted from the disease ontology, are published as linked data (RDF) with SPARQL endpoint (accessible API). 1554 diseases and 7080 abnormal states in six

Thus the discovery of new disease terms could arise
from future work based on such analyses.Once defined as a child, a disease
does not have another chance to be promoted.We combined disease-gene associations
from the two databases as in our previous work [1],
using the MEDIC merged disease vocabulary (down-

tem (UMLS) metathesaurus includes disease terms from
multiple taxonomies; while it is not intended to be an
ontology, its semantic network can identify some relation-
ships between terms [12].To further advance such
research and biomedical knowledge in the genomic era,
a recent National Academy of Sciences working group
has called for the development of new disease taxonomies
better suited to incorporate molecular information [4].

Background
Prioritization of candidate disease genes is a fundamental
challenge in human health with applications to understand
disease mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy [1–5].However, to the best of our knowledge, constructing and
integrating multiple gene similarity networks for prioriti-
zing disease genes has not been investigated well.Finally, we employee
the random walk with restart algorithm on the phenotype-gene bilayer network, which combines phenotype similarity
network, IGSN as well as phenotype-gene association network, to prioritize candidate disease genes.

ical literature is difficult to detect manually because of
growing number of papers.Thus biomedical entity rela-
tionship extraction is necessary to analysis biomedical
literature.Biomedical entity relationship extraction is the
extraction of inter-entity specific semantic relationships in

Methods
AQ21 rule learning
AQ21 is a multi-task ML and data mining system for
attributional rule learning and rule testing that can be
applied to a wide range of classification problems [17].Specifically, in the AQ21, hierarchical

termined structure of subject, event, form, item

medicine requires the mining and aggregation of clinical
data from multiple sources and entails novel approaches
to obtaining contextual observations.The QuestionnaireResponse resource is linked back to the Questionnaire resource
Leroux et al.Once completed, this should allow
the integration of the FHIR data model with the semantic
statistics vocabularies.
In order to meet the above-mentioned requirements of
RC, the authors developed PIBAS FedSPARQL,1 a plat-
form based on Semantic Web technologies that allows
end users to easily provide input data and run predefined
Federated SPARQL queries across multiple data sources
and detect similar data items, among data obtained from a
query.This allows them to select certain
properties of data sources to improve query results.Bio2RDF has transfigured and interrelated many biological
databases, offering a platform for constructing queries
across these data sources.By contrast, PIBAS FedSPARQL pre-
serves intermediate results because it is very important
for RC staff to gain all relevant data.Also, the novel “similar data items detection” algorithm can be particularly useful for
suggesting new data sources and cost optimization for new experiments.

Over the last dozen years, the biomedical research community has invested significant efforts in the development of
biomedical semantic annotation technology.While
the overview of application cases and state of the art
tools can be of relevance to practitioners in the biome-
dical domain, with the summary of potential areas for
further research, we are also targeting researchers who
are familiar with NLP, semantic technologies, and se-
mantic annotation in general, but have not been dealing
with the biomedical domain, as well as those who are

areas where the work in the biomedical semantic anno-

Conclusions: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for druggable targets including various
related information such as protein, gene, protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug,
mechanism of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information.DTO has been implemented in the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein
target disease relationships.DTO integrates and harmonizes knowledge
of the most important druggable protein families: kinases,
GPCRs, ion channels and nuclear hormone receptors.However, to the best of our knowledge, a
publically available structured knowledge resource of drug
target classifications and relevant annotations for the most
important protein families, one that facilitates querying, data
integration, re-use, and analysis does not currently exist.DTO
classifies the four major drug target protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on
phylogenecity, function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, chemical ligand and substrate
characteristics, and target-family specific characteristics.
Two major types of data
access mechanisms are normally provided by RDB2RDF
tools: i) data translation (a specific case of ETL - Extract,
Transform, Load -), where data are materialized into RDF
datasets and stored in a triple store (e.g., Virtuoso), which
provides a SPARQL endpoint; and ii) query translation,
where SPARQL queries are directly translated into SQL
according to the specified RDB2RDF mappings, and eval-
uated against the relational database, and where results
are translated back using the mappings to conform with
the SPARQL query.Background

Abstract
Background: Semantic interoperability is essential when carrying out post-genomic clinical trials where several
institutions collaborate, since researchers and developers need to have an integrated view and access to
heterogeneous data sources.This is the reason why we were looking into using a
Relational Database to RDF (RDB2RDF) solution.
As future work, we will consider to tackle specific ter-
minological categories where the classifiers fail to obtain
good performance, like biological processes and molecu-
lar functions.In the biomedical domain, plain rule-
based approaches like [2] have become rare; however,

NER proper, i.e.This paper’s focus is the technique called Named Entity
Recognition (herein NER), which solves the problem of
detecting terms belonging to a limited set of predefined
entity types.In particular, while the CRF
precision scores are generally good, if not almost opti-
mal for some categories, the results for chemicals and
sequences are very bad in terms of recall, hindering the
general performance of the system.

Abstract
Background: An experimental protocol is a sequence of tasks and operations executed to perform experimental
research in biological and biomedical areas, e.g.
(A) We first gathered up-to-date available bio-
logical information about the biological process.We describe and
apply below the approach (A) and (B) on a specific ex-
ample (the formation of the 30S initiation complex) for
illustrative purposes.As a proof of concept,
we developed the Bacterial interlocked Process ONtol-
ogy (BiPON) and showed that a) heterogeneous bio-
logical processes can be described with the systemic
representation and b) be linked automatically to math-
ematical models, and that c) information about these
processes can be enriched by automatic reasoning.37% of BiPON
classes stem from different well-established bio-ontologies, while the others have been manually defined and
curated.The Ontology
of Genes and Genomes provides a list of genes from dif-
ferent organisms including prokaryotes [17], while the Se-
quence Ontology (SO) provides a detailed description of
polymers and polymer sequence patterns [18].

suming at least one NCIt code were identified and the
corresponding classes were introduced in the model as
diagnoses.During the building pro-

subclasses of multiple diagnosis classes.The NCIt structure and the available relationships can help to bridge disease
classifications taking into account their structural and granular heterogeneities.The NCIt structure and the available relationships

Using VO,

fying hub or critical genes or nodes in the E. coli gene-
vaccine intearction network.Given so
many E. coli strains and different E. coli usages, it has been
a challenge in mining vaccine-related E. coli gene interac-

mining strategy, which identified important E. coli vaccine genes and their interactions with other genes through
specific interaction types.These E. coli gene names, vaccine
names, vaccine genes, and interaction keywords were

In the table, #PPIt is
the number of interactions in the network; #PPI is the
number of interactions in the group; Pct(%) presents the
percentage of interactions in the group.These methods
are proposed on the principle of guilt-by-association
(GBA), that is, the closer the two proteins are in the net-
work the more similar are their functions [5].Semantic
value of the ideal term can be estimated based on those
of the known terms of interacting proteins and func-
tional coefficient variation and descent direction of func-
tional specificity between them.In the tables, #PPI is the number of interac-
tions in the group; #SameDeg is the number of interac-
tions in which the interacting proteins with the same
degree in the group; #DiffDeg is the number of interac-
tions in which the interacting proteins with different de-
grees in the group; Pct(%) presents the percentage of
interactions in the group.(6), P(x)
is the set of predictive annotations; S is the target pro-
tein set for testing; m is the number of proteins which at
least have one predictive term.
Thus the discovery of new disease terms could arise
from future work based on such analyses.Once defined as a child, a disease
does not have another chance to be promoted.We combined disease-gene associations
from the two databases as in our previous work [1],
using the MEDIC merged disease vocabulary (down-
loaded from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database
[22] on February 3rd, 2016).The Unified Medical Language Sys-
tem (UMLS) metathesaurus includes disease terms from
multiple taxonomies; while it is not intended to be an
ontology, its semantic network can identify some relation-
ships between terms [12].To further advance such
research and biomedical knowledge in the genomic era,
a recent National Academy of Sciences working group
has called for the development of new disease taxonomies
better suited to incorporate molecular information [4].
These GO terms usually describe some processes or pathways of particular interest, which are related
to the experiment that is being performed.Gruca and Sikora Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2017) 8:23 Page 3 of 14

So far, to find co-appearance of Gene Ontology terms,
association rule induction algorithms were applied.Also, Gruca [23] applied FP-growth algorithm to
find combinations of GO terms for functional description
of genes.To help the expert during such analysis, a lot of tools
have been invented and successfully applied during last
years.Keywords: Functional description, Gene Ontology, Logical rules, Expert-driven rule induction

Trial integration In order to assess the feasibility of
the above approach, we conducted a trial integration of
some examples taken from the three-level ontology of
abnormal states, the disease ontology, and some typical
external resources, in which we used 386 abnormal
states consisting of 279 abnormal states that are super
classes of 107 states that are the bottom level classes
appearing in 12 typical diseases from three medical spe-
cializations, i.e., cardiovascular medicine, neurology, and
gastroenterology.Keywords: Disease ontology, Definition of diseases, River flow model of disease, Linked data, Navigation system
Background
Recently, medical information resources that store consid-
erable amount of data have become available.General disease chains
are represented as an aggregation of the definitions of
abnormal states.1554 diseases and 7080 abnormal states in six major clinical areas, which are
extracted from the disease ontology, are published as linked data (RDF) with SPARQL endpoint (accessible API). 1554 diseases and 7080 abnormal states in six

Ontology Recommender 1.0 sometimes suggests
ontologies with high specialization scores but with
very low input coverage, which makes the ontologies
inappropriate for the user’s input.This is an expected result,
given that the recommendation approach used by
Ontology Recommender 1.0 is based on the relation
between the number of annotations provided by each
ontology and its size, which is our measure for
ontology specialization.Suppose that a researcher needs to find the
best ontologies for a list of biomedical terms.Ontology Recommender 2.0 recommends over 500 biomedical ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal
platform, where it is openly available (both via the user interface at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/recommender,
and via a Web service API).This approach
has been implemented as release 2.0 of the NCBO
Ontology Recommender, a system that is able to find
the best ontologies for a biomedical text or set of
keywords.

Construction of the phenotype-gene bilayer network
We have got three networks, which are phenotype
similarity network, IGSN and phenotype-gene association
network respectively.We firstly construct five individual gene
similarity networks based on genomic data of genes.Keywords: Gene Ontology, Gene similarity networks, Similarity network fusion, Disease gene identification
Background
Prioritization of candidate disease genes is a fundamental
challenge in human health with applications to understand
disease mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy [1–5].However, to the best of our knowledge, constructing and
integrating multiple gene similarity networks for prioriti-
zing disease genes has not been investigated well.Finally, we employee
the random walk with restart algorithm on the phenotype-gene bilayer network, which combines phenotype similarity
network, IGSN as well as phenotype-gene association network, to prioritize candidate disease genes.
Methods
AQ21 rule learning
AQ21 is a multi-task ML and data mining system for
attributional rule learning and rule testing that can be
applied to a wide range of classification problems [17].Specifically, in the AQ21, hierarchical
relationships are part of the definition of attributes’
domains (set of possible values) that describe data.This is particularly valuable when
analyzing coded medical data with potentially hundreds
of thousands of binary attributes.Table 2
shows the number of patients who reported ADL limita-
tions before and after cancer diagnosis.Keywords: Machine learning, Bio-ontologies, Quality of life, Activities of daily living, SEER-MHOS

Precision medicine is an emerging approach for dis-
ease prevention and treatment that takes into account
individualized patient information including genomics,
environment, and lifestyle [1].

Background
There are more than 20 million literature abstracts
included in MEDLINE, which is the most authoritative
textual database in the field of biomedicine.The biomed-
ical literature is difficult to detect manually because of
growing number of papers.Thus biomedical entity rela-
tionship extraction is necessary to analysis biomedical
literature.Biomedical entity relationship extraction is the
extraction of inter-entity specific semantic relationships in
text [1, 2].The P, R, and F

Over the last dozen years, the biomedical research community has invested significant efforts in the development of
biomedical semantic annotation technology.While
the overview of application cases and state of the art
tools can be of relevance to practitioners in the biome-
dical domain, with the summary of potential areas for
further research, we are also targeting researchers who
are familiar with NLP, semantic technologies, and se-
mantic annotation in general, but have not been dealing
with the biomedical domain, as well as those who are
well aware of biomedical semantic technologies, but
have not been working on semantic annotation.and Bagheri Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2017) 8:44 Page 2 of 18

areas where the work in the biomedical semantic anno-
tation domain can be strengthened or expanded.While a suite of biomedical semantic annotation tools
is available for practical use, the biomedical community
is yet to heavily engage in and leverage the benefits of
such tools.The following section provides several examples of
practical benefits achievable through semantic anno-

Two major types of data
access mechanisms are normally provided by RDB2RDF
tools: i) data translation (a specific case of ETL - Extract,
Transform, Load -), where data are materialized into RDF
datasets and stored in a triple store (e.g., Virtuoso), which
provides a SPARQL endpoint; and ii) query translation,
where SPARQL queries are directly translated into SQL
according to the specified RDB2RDF mappings, and eval-
uated against the relational database, and where results
are translated back using the mappings to conform with
the SPARQL query.Background

Abstract
Background: Semantic interoperability is essential when carrying out post-genomic clinical trials where several
institutions collaborate, since researchers and developers need to have an integrated view and access to
heterogeneous data sources.This is the reason why we were looking into using a
Relational Database to RDF (RDB2RDF) solution.

Fig.The term “ontology” has many definitions depending on
the author and the way an ontology is built and used by
computer systems.Instead, an ontology becomes an artefact to
be used by other systems.Concepts are linked in one-
way allowing to connect from a large to a small structure
but not reverse.The experts team was com-
prised by histology professors, with more than five years
of teaching and research experience, and biomedical grad-
uate students, with mayor on histology, all of them formed
the research histology area.
In order to meet the above-mentioned requirements of
RC, the authors developed PIBAS FedSPARQL,1 a plat-
form based on Semantic Web technologies that allows
end users to easily provide input data and run predefined
Federated SPARQL queries across multiple data sources
and detect similar data items, among data obtained from a
query.This allows them to select certain
properties of data sources to improve query results.Bio2RDF has transfigured and interrelated many biological
databases, offering a platform for constructing queries
across these data sources.By contrast, PIBAS FedSPARQL pre-
serves intermediate results because it is very important
for RC staff to gain all relevant data.Also, the novel “similar data items detection” algorithm can be particularly useful for
suggesting new data sources and cost optimization for new experiments.
Lexical resources are also combined with
probabilistic models, as has been tried in [24].To the best of our knowledge, our previous work [13]
is the only research about the automatic simplification
of DPLs.Results: In our evaluation, we used the corpus EasyDPL (Easy Drug Package Leaflets), a collection of 306 leaflets
written in Spanish and manually annotated with 1400 adverse drug effects and their simplest synonyms.An ultimate goal of this work is to provide an automatic
approach that helps these companies to write drug package leaflets in an easy-to-understand language.Lexical resources (such asWordNet [23]) are used

Conclusions: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for druggable targets including various
related information such as protein, gene, protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug,
mechanism of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other types of information.DTO has been implemented in the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein
target disease relationships.DTO integrates and harmonizes knowledge
of the most important druggable protein families: kinases,
GPCRs, ion channels and nuclear hormone receptors.However, to the best of our knowledge, a
publically available structured knowledge resource of drug
target classifications and relevant annotations for the most
important protein families, one that facilitates querying, data
integration, re-use, and analysis does not currently exist.DTO
classifies the four major drug target protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on
phylogenecity, function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, chemical ligand and substrate
characteristics, and target-family specific characteristics.

logical information about the biological process.We describe and
apply below the approach (A) and (B) on a specific ex-
ample (the formation of the 30S initiation complex) for

we developed the Bacterial interlocked Process ONtol-
ogy (BiPON) and showed that a) heterogeneous bio-
logical processes can be described with the systemic
representation and b) be linked automatically to math-
ematical models, and that c) information about these
processes can be enriched by automatic reasoning.37% of BiPON
classes stem from different well-established bio-ontologies, while the others have been manually defined and
curated.The Ontology
of Genes and Genomes provides a list of genes from dif-
ferent organisms including prokaryotes [17], while the Se-
quence Ontology (SO) provides a detailed description of
polymers and polymer sequence patterns [18].

precision scores are generally good, if not almost opti-
mal for some categories, the results for chemicals and
sequences are very bad in terms of recall, hindering the
general performance of the system.
