We set out tologically represent the relationships between the genesencoding MHC, the haplotypes linking together groupsof genes in specific species, and the individual proteinscomprising MHC complexes, in order to present immuno-logical data in an exact way and to improve the functional-ity of our website.MHC class I molecules present epitopes to CD8+ Tcells and are made up of one alpha chain and one ?2microglobulin chain, which is invariant and encoded out-side the MHC locus.When a T cell re-sponds to an epitope, the identity of the MHC moleculepresenting the epitope may not be known at all, it maybe narrowed down to a subset of all possible moleculesor it may be exactly identified.Results and discussionOur MHC Restriction Ontology (MRO) is available in apreliminary state at https://github.com/IEDB/MRO.Thus knowing if theresponding T cell expresses CD4 verses CD8 can be used tonarrow down the possible MHC restriction into classes.
The relationship between theabnormal phenotype annotations made when assessing for agenotype effect by processing through A1 (standard statisticalanalysis pipeline) and A2 (statistical analysis including bodyweight as a covariate).Thus, we investigated solutions for thestandardised reporting of phenotypes after consideringbody weight as a confounder as a relative phenotypechange within existing semantic frameworks and reportour findings here.The model optimisation process means that the finalmodel will only include weight if it is statistically significant inexplaining variation in the data (p < 0.05)Tested: 850861703751 521Fig.Conclusions and future perspectivesIn gene-phenotype studies, we have identified challengeswith reporting phenotypes after adjusting for bodyweight using currently available semantic data represen-tation frameworks.With interestgrowing in the impact of body weight on phenotypesand the scale of projects being conducted by highthroughput phenotyping consortiums, being able to dis-seminate annotated phenotype data has become an im-portant issue.
Partial lexical map-pings leveraging increasingly aggressive normalization ofOrphanet terms were used to rank candidate mappingsfor comprehensive expert curation.1 Identifying partial lexical mappings between HPO and SNOMED CTDhombres and Bodenreider Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:3 Page 5 of 13Qualitative evaluationWe evaluated the quality of the partial mappings bymanual review of a random subset of 10 % of the partiallexical mappings.Terminologies, such as the Gene Ontology, have beenshown to be highly compositional [16, 17] in that someof their more complex terms are derived from simplerterms by addition of modifiers.We leveraged the lexico-syntacticproperties of phenotype terms to derived partial lexicalmappings, and the subsumption hierarchy of phenotypeconcepts to derive partial logical mappings.Sincemany HPO terms are demodified to the head nounAbnormality (mapped to Congenital malformation), thisissue also has a profound impact on the quality of thepartial lexical mappings.
This work en-hances the prospects for further research on evaluatingexergames and opens up new ways for open linked gamedata, thereby facilitating their analysis, verification andunderstanding by the scientific community.Complying with thehighest level in the 5-star open data scheme introducedby Tim Berners-Lee [66], this dataset is, to the best ofthe authors’ knowledge, the world’s first available opendataset of exergames metrics described semantically bymeans of Linked Open Data (LOD).Publishinggame results as open data will enable the exergame com-munity to test these data, validate their algorithms,Bamparopoulos et al.ConclusionsIn this work, a unified model for the semantic representa-tion of exergames is proposed, while actual data from gamesessions are published as open data on the web.Semantic description of game resultsalongside open access enables the biomedical semanticscommunity to develop automatic processing, analysisand visualization tools for these data.

investigated the drug –drug interaction (DDI) information in two publicallyavailable drug resources, NDF-RT and DrugBank [5].The workshopseries also covers vaccine and drug-related clinical datarepresentation and analysis, including clinically reportedvaccine and drug adverse events.In 2013,the name has been changed to “Vaccine and Drug OntologyStudies (VDOS)” to reflect the expansion in the scope tomore than just mechanism and effect.The 2014“Vaccine and Drug Ontology Studies” workshop (VDOS2014) was an international forum for researchers toidentify, propose, and discuss solutions for importantresearch problems in ontology representation and analysisof vaccine and drug development, administration, func-tion mechanisms, safety, and education.The first workshop of the series was organized as the“Vaccine and Drug Ontology in the Study of Mechanismand Effect” workshop (VDOSME 2012) [1] on July 21,2012, in Graz, Austria, as part of the third InternationalConference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO 2012).
A CTTV goal isto develop a better understanding of the rare and com-mon disease relationship via shared phenotypes, genes,and pathways, as information from rare disease can pro-vide mechanistic insight to common disease and viceversa.Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:8 Page 3 of 11Representation of the disease-phenotype association inan OWL ontology with the statement ‘disease has_phe-notype some phenotype’ requires that all instances of adisease have that specific phenotype and our examplesabove illustrate that this representation is problematicfor many cases.For example, the rare diseaseAicardi-Gourtieres syndrome has several associated phe-notypes affecting the brain, immune system, and skin,such as microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, elevatedblood liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and abnormalneurological response.OBAN representsassociations between a subject and object i.e., disease and its associated phenotypes and the source of evidence forthat association.The disease-phenotype associ-ation is established to represent disease connections viashared phenotypes.
Preservatives are added to a drug preparation to in-crease the lifetime of the drug preparation.Ac-tive ingredients are defined at the level of clinical drugform (for example, furosemide oral tablet) whereas ex-cipients exist at the level of branded drug (more specificthan clinical drug form), because each brand of a drugproduct such as furosemide 20 mg oral tablet typicallycontains a different set of excipients.Lubricant excipient role: An excipient role that is real-ized by a process of drug administration or a process ofdrug manufacturing and results in either 1) decreasedadhesion between drug ingredients and manufacturingequipment or between drug ingredients and some part ofan organism; 2) decreased friction between drug ingredi-ents and manufacturing equipment or between drugHanna et al.A researcher could use these represen-tations, for example, to identify all patients who are tak-ing one drug that inhibits a given isoenzyme andanother drug that is metabolized by it, and thus is at riskfor adverse effects of the latter drug (that is, the inhib-ition caused by the first drug will reduce the metabol-lism of the second drug, leading to increased levels andthus increased risk of toxicity).SPLs are a digitalform of the physical product label that the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) collects from drug manufacturers.
However, by usingsimplification constructs identified by iSimp, we cangenerate a simple sentence from the original sentencethat states the relationship in a straightforward way:“Mir-21 is implicated in the development of pancreaticcancer.” iSimp tags the following syntactic constructs:(i) A conjunction in the form of a list of elements(“miR-21, miR-210, miR-155, and miR-196a”),(ii) A conjunction (“proven or predicted”),(iii)The appositive construct involving the two nounphrases “four miRNAs” and “miR-21, miR-210,miR-155, and miR-196a”,(iv)The reduced relative clause “all implicated in thedevelopment of pancreatic cancer with either provenor predicted target genes”, which modifies the nounphrase “four miRNAs”(v)Another reduced relative clause “involved in criticalcancer-associated cellular pathways”, which modifiesthe noun phrase “target genes”Using constructs (i) and (iii) we can replace “fourmiRNAs” by “miR-21” in the construct (iv) and thusGupta et al.The abstracts were selected to be focused on diseases (i.e.,a disease is mentioned in the title, the first or the last sen-tence of the abstract, or three or more times throughoutthe abstracts, as defined in the work by Tudor et al.Methods: We have developed miRiaD (microRNAs in association with Disease), a text-mining tool thatautomatically extracts associations between microRNAs and diseases from the literature.miRiaD processes this list of PMIDs and displays the trip-lets < miR,Disease,Text Evidence/PMID>.miRs have also beenlinked to many other diseases, including cardiovasculardisease [3], diabetes [4], neurological disease [5] and liver[6] and intestinal [7] disorders.

In the HMDC, searches for mouse data are re-stricted to only the derived gene-to-phenotype andgene-to-disease annotations.For genotypes associated with a docking siteand a single expressed mouse gene, gene-to-phenotypeand gene-to-disease annotations are derived for theexpressed gene and not for the docking site.As this leaves asingle transgene marker and a single expressed mousegene, gene level annotions are derived for both thetransgene and the expressed mouse gene.Gene-to-phenotypeand gene-to-disease annotations may be derived for atransgene and also an endogenous mouse gene in twocases: 1) if the genotype contains only a single transgenewhich carries a single inserted expressed mouse gene(Fig.Gene-to-phenotype and gene-to-disease annotations are thenderived for genes and genomic markers in genotypeswith a single remaining locus.
Having provided an informal account of what consti-tutes blindness we now provide a formalization of thesolution.Governmental organizations implement their ownstandards for blindness.Even given these complications regarding blindness,we contend that it is useful to give a univocal account ofthe phenomenon for purposes of ontological deve-lopment.If blindness is an inability to detectlight, then all cases of blindness will be a complete inabil-ity to detect light stimulus, which fails to capture the casesof blindness that are not the complete inability to detectlight stimulus.Given the above considerations, one might concludethat there is not a single coherent ontological categorythat corresponds to what blindness is as an entity.
To automate the XML con-version of BMRB entries, we have developed a softwaresuite (the BMRBxTool) that generates XML documentsand validates their format and data consistency accordingto the BMRB/XML schema.Findings: To enhance the interoperability of the BMRB database, we present a full conversion of BMRB entries totwo standard structured data formats, XML and RDF, as common open representations of the NMR-STAR data.Keywords: NMR, BMRB, Database, XML, RDFFindingsBackgroundThe BioMagResBank (BMRB; http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/)is a worldwide data repository for experimental and de-rived data gathered from nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectroscopic studies of biological molecules [1].Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:16 Page 2 of 4BMRB would be to convert the archive into standardweb formats, XML and RDF, using a data structure thatcorresponds closely to the NMR-STAR ontologydescribed by an XML schema and OWL.MethodsWe have extended the NMR-STAR Dictionary to accom-modate the derived data repositories on BMRB, such asLACS validation reports [5], structural annotations usingPACSY [6] and Protein Blocks [7], etc., followed by transla-tion of the dictionary to an XML schema [8] (BMRB/XMLSchema), using the PDBx/mmCIF Dictionary Suite de-veloped by the Research Collaboratory for StructuralBioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB)(http://sw-tools.rcsb.org/).
EFOenriches these existing ontologies by including additionalaxioms that connect terms like diseases to tissues andanatomical systems; cell lines to cell types, diseases andtissue; and link common and rare diseases through asso-ciated anatomical parts and phenotypes.Priorto the work presented here most cell lines have beenadded to EFO for the ENCODE project using Excel-based spreadsheets that were processed with Populous[17].Four of these templates are foradding new terms to EFO that include new cell lines,Jupp et al.Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:17 Page 2 of 8shields the users from the underlying OWL vocabulary.Jupp et al.
The ontology willalso reduce confusion in facilitating the identification ofsynonymous concepts when it comes to the variedreporting of the results of prokaryotic diagnostic assays(as discussed above).Theontology uses a controlled vocabulary, detailed annota-tions, and an extensive set of logical axioms to connectprokaryotic classes (including qualities, processes, assays,and entities) to terms from 19 outside ontologies.ConclusionsMicrO is an ontology of prokaryotic phenotypes andmetabolic characters, which also includes classes formicrobiological media recipes and diagnostic assays.Future ontology devel-opment will include incorporation of pathogenic phe-notypes (such as hosts, target organs, and diseases)and prokaryotic habitats.The logical axioms that werecreated were designed to facilitate future studies that relyon the logical inference power of the ontology to gainhigher-order knowledge of microbial taxa based on thechemical composition of their growth media, such asstudies seeking to identify correlations between phylogenyand culture medium chemistry [45].
This first definition of the term ‘exosome’ has beensubsequently overlooked at least twice, first in 1987 byinvestigators studying the vesicular secretion of thetransferrin receptor, who adopted a more restrictive def-inition of the term, conflating it with a delayed mode ofvesicle secretion in which the vesicles bud at endosomemembranes to create a multivesicular body (MVB),followed later by MVB fusion with the plasma mem-brane to release the vesicles into the extracellular space([25]).Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link tothe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.Given the inconsistent vesicle nomenclatures prior tothese ISEV efforts, these were major advances.Aspart of these efforts, MWG matched metadata terms toexisting biomedical ontologies and identified theexRNA-relevant terms that were absent from major on-tologies such as the Gene Ontology (GO).The MWG identified existing biomedical ontologiesaccessible through the NCBO BioPortal [37] as a sourceof commonly accepted terms for annotating exRNAdatasets.

Past studies have shown that the identification of the phrases describing biological processes, also known as triggerdetection, is a crucial part of event extraction, and notable overall performance gains can be obtained by solelyfocusing on this sub-task.Forinstance, misclassifying a correct trigger with frequencyof 200 will translate into removing 200 correct events,comparing it with the removal of a correct trigger with fre-quency of only 1.Interestingly, inall three cases, in comparison with manual annotationmethod it has a higher precision and F-score.This evaluation, however, measures the annotation of thefull event structures and no direct conclusions can bemade for the trigger annotations.Precision, recall andF2-score in this table are calculated based on thecounts of the predicted triggers.

Since then, Semantic Web technologieshave been increasingly applied in the EHR domain withdifferent purposes: representation of clinical models anddata [17–19]; interoperability of models and data [20–22];application of quality measurements and protocols todata [23, 24].Ontology transformation patternsThe previous basic rules do not support all the types oftransformations needed in order to get semantically-richdatasets, because sometimes we need (1) to define rulesthat involvemultiple input entities and one ormany ontol-ogy classes, or (2) to add additional information to enrichthe input data.In this paper we also describe how we haveapplied SWIT in different biomedical scenarios and some lessons learned.SWIT is able to apply the Linked Open Data principles in the generation of the datasets, so allowing forlinking their content to external repositories and creating linked open datasets.Let IR be the set of datatype properties and object prop-erties of the ontology that univocally defines the identityfor the class C.

BioPortalThe National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO)[17], based at Stanford University, provides online toolsfor accessing and integrating ontological resources, in-cluding BioPortal, a repository of biomedical ontologies.To construct drug-disease associations from the text ofCPG recommendations and SPL treatment indications,we apply text mining methods using an expanded set ofdrug and disease names from multiple terminologicalresources with taxonomic structure, such as NDF-RT(National Drug Formulary – Reference Terminology) andMESH (Medical Subject Headings), and a data source ondrugs, SIDER.EvaluationTo evaluate the approach of identifying drug names inCPG text, one annotator with medical expertise (TL)manually annotated drug names and drug classes in fiveguideline summaries for heart failure to construct a ref-erence standard using TextAE, a text annotation client[18].Second, utilizingexisting annotated clinical or biomedical corpora [4, 22]would allow evaluation of the approach against existingNER tools.EachSPL contains a structured section on Indications, whichspecifies diseases or clinical conditions for which the drugis FDA-approved for use.

FALDO has been designed to be general enough todescribe the position of annotations on nucleotide andprotein sequences using the various levels of locationcomplexity used in major databases such as INSDC(DDBJ, NCBI-GenBank and EMBL-Bank) and UniProt,their associated file formats, and other generic annotationfile formats such as Browser Extensible Data (BED), GTFand GFF3.Thisproperty is used to distinguish between a conceptual geneas an “unit of inheritance” and the corresponding repre-sentation of the DNA sequence region encoding the geneas stored in a database.Discussion and prototyping with representa-tives from major sequence databases such as UniProt[12], DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan) [13] (part of theINSDC partnership with the National Center for Biotech-nology Information (NCBI)-GenBank [14] and EuropeanMolecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)-Bank [15]), and anumber of glycomics databases (BCSDB [16], GlycomeDB[17], GLYCOSCIENCES.de [18], JCGGDB, RINGS [19]and UniCarbKB [20]) and assorted open source devel-opers during these meetings led to the development ofthe Feature Annotation Location Description Ontology(FALDO).Bolleman et al.Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:39 Page 2 of 12Although non-trivial, file format interconversion is acommon background task in current script-centric bioin-formatics pipelines, often essential for combining toolssupporting different formats or format variants.
Like in thekNN-based approach, the documents are processed usingthe following techniques: segmentation into sentences,tokenization, removal of stop words and normalizationusing the Porter's stemming algorithm [23].Our experiments show that our kNN-based approachis promising for biomedical documents classification inthe context of a large collection.These sys-tems require therefore considerable resources in terms ofcomputation and storage compared to our kNN-basedapproach.Our main contribution is to be ableto suggest relevant topics to any new document basedsolely on portion of it thanks to a classification modellearnt from a large collection containing several hundredsof thousands of previously annotated documents.Compared to existing kNN-based methods, our method uses classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for rankingthe labels.
Additionally, con-sidering the plot in Fig.Hence,functional coherence here is derived essentially from thesupporting literature, thus making the method sensitive toBastos et al.These functional annotations are associations of proteins (or other biological sequences) with descriptorscharacterizing their biological roles.These sets were made by replacing the original proteins with increasing amounts (of 10% increments; 100 iterations) of randomproteins (taken from the CAZy database)Bastos et al.It should be notedthat on the term-for-term approach the graph nature ofGO will lead to a statistical dependency issue.
Conclusion: Knowledge Author can support clinical domain content development for information extraction bysupporting semantic schema creation by domain experts.To improveease of use and support wide-spread adoption of theSchema Ontology, a system which minimizes complexityand allows simple interaction for users is needed.Within the clinicaldomain, NLP systems have been implemented to supportpharmaco-vigilance, patient screening, patient narrativesummarization, and quality improvement [6–13].Semanticmodifiers vary depending on the semantic typeassociated with the concept.In the clinical domain, creating a semantic schema typically requires input from both a domain expert, such as aclinician, and an NLP expert who will represent clinical concepts created from the clinician’s domain expertiseinto a computable format usable by an NLP system.
Thestudy extends the overview of all three tasks [32] andorganizers’ working notes on Task 2 [34, 57] by focus-ing on Task 2 in significantly greater depth, focusing on1) the difficulty of handling multiple short form senses,and 2) the utility of each participating system with re-spect to a vocabulary containing simplified health termsfor potentially supporting patient understanding ofclinical text.MethodsIn this section, we describe the short form schema, data-set, shared task, sense categorization, and short formcoverage using the Consumer Health Vocabulary.In terms of normalizing short forms with commonCUIs between the Consumer Health Vocabulary and theShARe test set, participant systems’ demonstrated mod-erate to reasonable accuracy suggesting promising re-sults for supporting patient understanding of clinicaltext by replacing these concepts with a more lay term orlinking these terms to web resources.The ShARe/CLEF shortform test set consists of 860 unique terms and 706unique Unified Medical Language System CUIs.With recent patient-centered initiatives, the focus ofthe 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Challenge was to facilitatedevelopment of natural language processing applicationsthat could be used to help patients understand the contentof a clinical report, and Task 2 focused on normalizationof short forms.
The CL is built according to the principles establishedby the OBO Foundry [5] and is the designated candidateontology for metazoan cell types within the Foundry.In addition, subtypes of the class ‘cell in vitro’ have received improved definitions and labels to provide formodularity with the representation of cells in the Cell Line Ontology and Reagent Ontology.The CL will continue to maintain general cell types forrepresentation of non-mammalian cells where no separ-ate resource or ontology exists and will remain the prin-cipal ontology for the representation of mammalian celltypes.AcknowledgementsWe would kindly thank Barry Smith, Lindsay Cowell, Anna Maria Masci,Richard Scheuermann, Jose Mejino, David Hill, Terry Hayamizu, MorganHightshoe, Wade Valleau, Jane Lomax, Paola Roncaglia, Tanya Berardini,Heiko Dietze, Maryann Martone, Stephan Larson, Gordon Shepherd, JylBoline, Mihail Bota, Giorgio Ascoli, Paul Katz, Robert Burgess, Patrick Ray,Jonathan Bona, Paula Mabee, Laurel Cooper, Ramona Walls, Pankaj Jaiswal,Darren Natale, Cathy Wu, Cecilia Arighi, Alistair Forrest, Hideya Kawaji, HelenParkison, Simon Jupp, Robert Stevens, Ryan Brinkmann, Melanie Courtot,Raphael Gottardo, Cliburn Chan, Jie Zheng, Shai Shen-Orr, and YannickPouliot, for discussions about and contributions to the Cell Ontology project.Forexample, the Kidney and Urinary Pathway Ontology was used as a template to populate the CL with additional celltypes.
Considerable ef-forts have been invested to process and manually curatehuge amounts of data that is required to build such aknowledge base around a specific indication.Although several disease modelsexist, they often do not consider the quality of underlying data.We used SPARQL to traverse each of these knowledgegraphs (derived from distinct resources) in an integrativemanner, allowing highly disease specific analysis of theunderlying data.The importance of semanticmining in the life science domain was brought to lime-light by the Bio2RDF project [27], which demonstratedthe possibility of querying life science knowledgebasesby linking public bioinformatics databases and providingpublic SPARQL endpoints.Prioritization of AD candidatesTo illustrate the potential of NeuroRDF approach and todetermine novel AD candidates from the high qualityintegrated data, we exploit the underlying biologicalassociation between the different data resources andidentify the previously unknown information.
A delta is a set of operations on entities (nodes orattributes, respectively) necessary to transform onedocument into another [11].In our example, aMismatchWithPublication caused an update of theparameter value.Basedon the resulting set of annotations, differences can becharacterised and classified.The XML-encoded serialisation providesthe new and the old value of Km1:<update><attribute id="1"oldPath="/sbml[1]/../parameter[1]"name="value" newValue="23.42"oldValue="23.24" [...] /></update>Using COMODI the detected update can now be anno-tated.More specifically, we started our investigation by man-ually analysing a predefined set of cell cycle models2from BioModels [12].

However, enabling automated reasoning over multipleontologies is a challenging task, since automated reason-ing can be highly complex and costly in terms of timeand memory consumption [11].2Institute of Translational Medicine, UniversityHospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, B15 2TT Birmingham, UnitedKingdom.We have also identified a number of ontologies forwhich performance of automated reasoning, at least whenusing AberOWL and the ELK reasoner, is significantlyworse, which renders them particularly problematic forapplications that carry heavy parallel loads.AcknowledgementsThis paper is an extended version of a conference paper by the same name,presented at ICBO 2015.Author details1College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and GenomicSciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham, B15 2TTBirmingham, United Kingdom.

MethodsOBCS developmentOBCS is a community-based ontology of statistical toolsand methods used in biological and clinical investigationsthat follows OBO Foundry principles in providing the pos-sibility for enhanced representation and analysis of datagenerated through complex statistical procedures.Overall, we believe that OBCS is a timely ontology ableto represent statistics-related terms and their relations ina rigorous fashion, facilitate standard data analysis andintegration, and support reproducible biological andclinical research.OBCS provides a timely source of statistical termsand semantics in various areas of biological and clinicalstatistics.OBCS provides a consensus-based rigorouslycurated representation of the steps involved in statisticspipelines in different domains in biological and clinicalfields, thereby supporting reproducibility of research.In this paper, we haveintroduced Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics(OBCS), focusing on the introduction of high level sta-tistics terms in OBCS and on how OBCS can be used incombination with OBI for the ontological representationof statistics-related biological and clinical data process-ing.
Scenario 6: diagnosis by non-humanThe diagnostic decision support system has made a diag-nosis (or misdiagnosis depending on whether it is correct),because it (1) takes as input a clinical picture and repre-sentations of the relevant disease type and one or moretypes of phenotypes with which it is associated; (2) partici-pates in a process of making a conclusion based on thisinput; and (3) outputs from this process a statement abouta configuration involving an organism, a disease, and adisease type.3 Misdiagnosis of type of disease.Scenario #5: layperson’s justifiable conclusionMr. Jones’ daughter, upon learning of her father’s type 2diabetes mellitus, adds this information into her letter toher brother, writing “Dad has type 2 diabetes mellitus”.Keywords: Biomedical ontology, Referent tracking, Disease, Diagnosis, Information content entity, Representation,Ontological realismBackgroundAs administrative, clinical, and patient-reported data areincreasingly shared and reused, especially for patientcare [1–4] and research [1, 5–7], several issues withthese data—including diagnosis data—are of increasingconcern.2 Diagram of diagnostic process, its inputs, a correct diagnosis, its concretization, and the configuration that that the concretization is aboutHogan and Ceusters Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:54 Page 8 of 15past diagnosis to infer a clinical picture.
