We set out to
logically represent the relationships between the genes
encoding MHC, the haplotypes linking together groups
of genes in specific species, and the individual proteins
comprising MHC complexes, in order to present immuno-
logical data in an exact way and to improve the functional-
ity of our website.MHC class I molecules present epitopes to CD8+ T
cells and are made up of one alpha chain and one ?2
microglobulin chain, which is invariant and encoded out-
side the MHC locus.When a T cell re-
sponds to an epitope, the identity of the MHC molecule
presenting the epitope may not be known at all, it may
be narrowed down to a subset of all possible molecules
or it may be exactly identified.Results and discussion
Our MHC Restriction Ontology (MRO) is available in a
preliminary state at https://github.com/IEDB/MRO.Thus knowing if the
responding T cell expresses CD4 verses CD8 can be used to
narrow down the possible MHC restriction into classes.
The relationship between the
abnormal phenotype annotations made when assessing for a
genotype effect by processing through A1 (standard statistical
analysis pipeline) and A2 (statistical analysis including body
weight as a covariate).Thus, we investigated solutions for the
standardised reporting of phenotypes after considering
body weight as a confounder as a relative phenotype
change within existing semantic frameworks and report
our findings here.The model optimisation process means that the final
model will only include weight if it is statistically significant in
explaining variation in the data (p < 0.05)

Fig.Conclusions and future perspectives
In gene-phenotype studies, we have identified challenges
with reporting phenotypes after adjusting for body
weight using currently available semantic data represen-
tation frameworks.With interest
growing in the impact of body weight on phenotypes
and the scale of projects being conducted by high
throughput phenotyping consortiums, being able to dis-
seminate annotated phenotype data has become an im-
portant issue.

Dhombres and Bodenreider Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:3 Page 5 of 13
Qualitative evaluation
We evaluated the quality of the partial mappings by
manual review of a random subset of 10 % of the partial
lexical mappings.Terminologies, such as the Gene Ontology, have been
shown to be highly compositional [16, 17] in that some
of their more complex terms are derived from simpler
terms by addition of modifiers.We leveraged the lexico-syntactic
properties of phenotype terms to derived partial lexical
mappings, and the subsumption hierarchy of phenotype
concepts to derive partial logical mappings.Since
many HPO terms are demodified to the head noun
Abnormality (mapped to Congenital malformation), this
issue also has a profound impact on the quality of the
partial lexical mappings.
This work en-
hances the prospects for further research on evaluating
exergames and opens up new ways for open linked game
data, thereby facilitating their analysis, verification and
understanding by the scientific community.Complying with the
highest level in the 5-star open data scheme introduced
by Tim Berners-Lee [66], this dataset is, to the best of
the authors’ knowledge, the world’s first available open
dataset of exergames metrics described semantically by
means of Linked Open Data (LOD).Publishing
game results as open data will enable the exergame com-
munity to test these data, validate their algorithms,
Bamparopoulos et al.Conclusions
In this work, a unified model for the semantic representa-
tion of exergames is proposed, while actual data from game
sessions are published as open data on the web.Semantic description of game results
alongside open access enables the biomedical semantics
community to develop automatic processing, analysis
and visualization tools for these data.

series also covers vaccine and drug-related clinical data
representation and analysis, including clinically reported
vaccine and drug adverse events.In 2013,
the name has been changed to “Vaccine and Drug Ontology

more than just mechanism and effect.The 2014
“Vaccine and Drug Ontology Studies” workshop (VDOS
2014) was an international forum for researchers to
identify, propose, and discuss solutions for important
research problems in ontology representation and analysis
of vaccine and drug development, administration, func-
tion mechanisms, safety, and education.The first workshop of the series was organized as the
“Vaccine and Drug Ontology in the Study of Mechanism
and Effect” workshop (VDOSME 2012) [1] on July 21,
2012, in Graz, Austria, as part of the third International
Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO 2012).
A CTTV goal is
to develop a better understanding of the rare and com-
mon disease relationship via shared phenotypes, genes,
and pathways, as information from rare disease can pro-
vide mechanistic insight to common disease and vice
versa.Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:8 Page 3 of 11
Representation of the disease-phenotype association in
an OWL ontology with the statement ‘disease has_phe-
notype some phenotype’ requires that all instances of a
disease have that specific phenotype and our examples
above illustrate that this representation is problematic
for many cases.For example, the rare disease
Aicardi-Gourtieres syndrome has several associated phe-
notypes affecting the brain, immune system, and skin,
such as microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated
blood liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal
neurological response.OBAN represents
associations between a subject and object i.e., disease and its associated phenotypes and the source of evidence for
that association.The disease-phenotype associ-
ation is established to represent disease connections via
shared phenotypes.
Preservatives are added to a drug preparation to in-
crease the lifetime of the drug preparation.Ac-
tive ingredients are defined at the level of clinical drug
form (for example, furosemide oral tablet) whereas ex-
cipients exist at the level of branded drug (more specific
than clinical drug form), because each brand of a drug
product such as furosemide 20 mg oral tablet typically
contains a different set of excipients.Lubricant excipient role: An excipient role that is real-
ized by a process of drug administration or a process of
drug manufacturing and results in either 1) decreased
adhesion between drug ingredients and manufacturing
equipment or between drug ingredients and some part of
an organism; 2) decreased friction between drug ingredi-
ents and manufacturing equipment or between drug
Hanna et al.A researcher could use these represen-
tations, for example, to identify all patients who are tak-
ing one drug that inhibits a given isoenzyme and
another drug that is metabolized by it, and thus is at risk
for adverse effects of the latter drug (that is, the inhib-
ition caused by the first drug will reduce the metabol-
lism of the second drug, leading to increased levels and
thus increased risk of toxicity).SPLs are a digital
form of the physical product label that the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) collects from drug manufacturers.
However, by using
simplification constructs identified by iSimp, we can
generate a simple sentence from the original sentence
that states the relationship in a straightforward way:
“Mir-21 is implicated in the development of pancreatic
cancer.” iSimp tags the following syntactic constructs:
(i) A conjunction in the form of a list of elements
(“miR-21, miR-210, miR-155, and miR-196a”),
(ii) A conjunction (“proven or predicted”),
(iii)The appositive construct involving the two noun
phrases “four miRNAs” and “miR-21, miR-210,
miR-155, and miR-196a”,
(iv)The reduced relative clause “all implicated in the
development of pancreatic cancer with either proven
or predicted target genes”, which modifies the noun
phrase “four miRNAs”
(v)Another reduced relative clause “involved in critical
cancer-associated cellular pathways”, which modifies
the noun phrase “target genes”
Using constructs (i) and (iii) we can replace “four
miRNAs” by “miR-21” in the construct (iv) and thus

Introduction
The Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group
(BRIDG) model is a formal domain analysis model for
protocol-driven biomedical research, and serves as the
semantic foundation for application and message devel-
opment in the standards developing organizations
(SDOs) [1, 2].The main purpose of
the tools developed in this study is to support SDOs
such as CDISC to create information models that can
enable data exchange between clinical care systems
(e.g., in a CIMI model) and clinical trial systems (e.g.,
in a BRIDG model).Conclusions
In summary, we developed and evaluated a Semantic
Web –based approach that integrates the model ele-
ments from both BRIDG model and ISO 21090 model
and enables a domain-specific template generation mech-
anism for supporting clinical study metadata standards de-
velopment.

Rep significantly in terms of DEI relation extraction.Table 1 Example sentences with drug enzyme relations from

In the HMDC, searches for mouse data are re-
stricted to only the derived gene-to-phenotype and
gene-to-disease annotations.For genotypes associated with a docking site
and a single expressed mouse gene, gene-to-phenotype
and gene-to-disease annotations are derived for the
expressed gene and not for the docking site.As this leaves a
single transgene marker and a single expressed mouse
gene, gene level annotions are derived for both the
transgene and the expressed mouse gene.Gene-to-phenotype
and gene-to-disease annotations may be derived for a
transgene and also an endogenous mouse gene in two
cases: 1) if the genotype contains only a single transgene
which carries a single inserted expressed mouse gene
(Fig.Gene-
to-phenotype and gene-to-disease annotations are then
derived for genes and genomic markers in genotypes
with a single remaining locus.
Having provided an informal account of what consti-
tutes blindness we now provide a formalization of the
solution.Governmental organizations implement their own
standards for blindness.Even given these complications regarding blindness,
we contend that it is useful to give a univocal account of
the phenomenon for purposes of ontological deve-
lopment.If blindness is an inability to detect
light, then all cases of blindness will be a complete inabil-
ity to detect light stimulus, which fails to capture the cases
of blindness that are not the complete inability to detect
light stimulus.Given the above considerations, one might conclude
that there is not a single coherent ontological category
that corresponds to what blindness is as an entity.
To automate the XML con-
version of BMRB entries, we have developed a software
suite (the BMRBxTool) that generates XML documents
and validates their format and data consistency according
to the BMRB/XML schema.Findings: To enhance the interoperability of the BMRB database, we present a full conversion of BMRB entries to
two standard structured data formats, XML and RDF, as common open representations of the NMR-STAR data.Keywords: NMR, BMRB, Database, XML, RDF
Findings
Background
The BioMagResBank (BMRB; http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/)
is a worldwide data repository for experimental and de-
rived data gathered from nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopic studies of biological molecules [1].Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:16 Page 2 of 4
BMRB would be to convert the archive into standard
web formats, XML and RDF, using a data structure that
corresponds closely to the NMR-STAR ontology
described by an XML schema and OWL.Methods
We have extended the NMR-STAR Dictionary to accom-
modate the derived data repositories on BMRB, such as
LACS validation reports [5], structural annotations using
PACSY [6] and Protein Blocks [7], etc., followed by transla-
tion of the dictionary to an XML schema [8] (BMRB/XML
Schema), using the PDBx/mmCIF Dictionary Suite de-
veloped by the Research Collaboratory for Structural

enriches these existing ontologies by including additional
axioms that connect terms like diseases to tissues and
anatomical systems; cell lines to cell types, diseases and
tissue; and link common and rare diseases through asso-
ciated anatomical parts and phenotypes.Prior

added to EFO for the ENCODE project using Excel-
based spreadsheets that were processed with Populous

The ontology will
also reduce confusion in facilitating the identification of
synonymous concepts when it comes to the varied
reporting of the results of prokaryotic diagnostic assays
(as discussed above).The
ontology uses a controlled vocabulary, detailed annota-
tions, and an extensive set of logical axioms to connect
prokaryotic classes (including qualities, processes, assays,
and entities) to terms from 19 outside ontologies.Conclusions
MicrO is an ontology of prokaryotic phenotypes and
metabolic characters, which also includes classes for
microbiological media recipes and diagnostic assays.Future ontology devel-
opment will include incorporation of pathogenic phe-
notypes (such as hosts, target organs, and diseases)
and prokaryotic habitats.The logical axioms that were
created were designed to facilitate future studies that rely
on the logical inference power of the ontology to gain
higher-order knowledge of microbial taxa based on the
chemical composition of their growth media, such as
studies seeking to identify correlations between phylogeny
and culture medium chemistry [45].
This first definition of the term ‘exosome’ has been
subsequently overlooked at least twice, first in 1987 by
investigators studying the vesicular secretion of the
transferrin receptor, who adopted a more restrictive def-
inition of the term, conflating it with a delayed mode of
vesicle secretion in which the vesicles bud at endosome
membranes to create a multivesicular body (MVB),
followed later by MVB fusion with the plasma mem-
brane to release the vesicles into the extracellular space

part of these efforts, MWG matched metadata terms to
existing biomedical ontologies and identified the

of commonly accepted terms for annotating exRNA
datasets.

knowledge base.
Past studies have shown that the identification of the phrases describing biological processes, also known as trigger
detection, is a crucial part of event extraction, and notable overall performance gains can be obtained by solely
focusing on this sub-task.For
instance, misclassifying a correct trigger with frequency
of 200 will translate into removing 200 correct events,
comparing it with the removal of a correct trigger with fre-
quency of only 1.Interestingly, in
all three cases, in comparison with manual annotation
method it has a higher precision and F-score.This evaluation, however, measures the annotation of the
full event structures and no direct conclusions can be
made for the trigger annotations.Precision, recall and
F2-score in this table are calculated based on the
counts of the predicted triggers.
These new terms were
annotated with appropriate meta-data, such as synonyms
and definitions that reflect how the terms are used in
the data and literature.The CMPO Webulous templates have been used
by the Image Data Repository (IDR) curators as a mech-
anism for adding new terms to CMPO for both cellular
process and cellular protein localisation phenotypes.2 Screenshot of the Image Data Repository showing image meta-data that include phenotype annotation to CMPO term “decreased
duration of mitotic prophase” [CMPO:0000329]
Jupp et al.The size and automatic label creation
strategy also made it difficult for the biocurators to
find terms for annotating data.Results
As of release 1.9 CMPO contains 361 phenotype terms.

revealed remarkable scientific insights into drug-
associated neuropathy adverse events.Neuropathy refers herein to nerve damaging.

Since then, Semantic Web technologies
have been increasingly applied in the EHR domain with
different purposes: representation of clinical models and
data [17–19]; interoperability of models and data [20–22];
application of quality measurements and protocols to
data [23, 24].Ontology transformation patterns
The previous basic rules do not support all the types of
transformations needed in order to get semantically-rich
datasets, because sometimes we need (1) to define rules
that involvemultiple input entities and one ormany ontol-
ogy classes, or (2) to add additional information to enrich
the input data.In this paper we also describe how we have
applied SWIT in different biomedical scenarios and some lessons learned.SWIT is able to apply the Linked Open Data principles in the generation of the datasets, so allowing for
linking their content to external repositories and creating linked open datasets.Let IR be the set of datatype properties and object prop-
erties of the ontology that univocally defines the identity
for the class C. The identity_rule(C, IR) means that all
the individuals of C with the same value for the elements
in IR are considered the same.

for accessing and integrating ontological resources, in-
cluding BioPortal, a repository of biomedical ontologies.To construct drug-disease associations from the text of
CPG recommendations and SPL treatment indications,
we apply text mining methods using an expanded set of
drug and disease names from multiple terminological
resources with taxonomic structure, such as NDF-RT
(National Drug Formulary – Reference Terminology) and

drugs, SIDER.Evaluation

Methods
Ontology construction
DermO was constructed by domain experts using the
framework of the most recent definitive text on Derma-
tology edited by Bolognia et al.Content, relations and mapping to other ontologies
DermO was constructed as a simple ontology with limited
polyhierarchy, and currently contains 3,425 classes (Fig.Conclusions: DermO is an ontology with broad coverage of the domain of dermatologic disease and we
demonstrate here its utility for text mining and investigation of phenotypic relationships between dermatologic
disorders.There have been
repeated initiatives to generate structured terminologies
of sufficient granularity to accurately capture skin dis-
ease diagnoses, but the available tools, such as ICD-10,
remain blunt instruments in the face of the pressing
need for precision phenotyping, and are unsuitable for
many types of computation-based research.Results: We have developed an ontology of cutaneous disease, constructed manually by domain experts.
FALDO has been designed to be general enough to
describe the position of annotations on nucleotide and
protein sequences using the various levels of location
complexity used in major databases such as INSDC
(DDBJ, NCBI-GenBank and EMBL-Bank) and UniProt,
their associated file formats, and other generic annotation
file formats such as Browser Extensible Data (BED), GTF
and GFF3.This
property is used to distinguish between a conceptual gene
as an “unit of inheritance” and the corresponding repre-
sentation of the DNA sequence region encoding the gene
as stored in a database.Discussion and prototyping with representa-
tives from major sequence databases such as UniProt
[12], DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan) [13] (part of the
INSDC partnership with the National Center for Biotech-
nology Information (NCBI)-GenBank [14] and European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)-Bank [15]), and a
number of glycomics databases (BCSDB [16], GlycomeDB
[17], GLYCOSCIENCES.de [18], JCGGDB, RINGS [19]
and UniCarbKB [20]) and assorted open source devel-
opers during these meetings led to the development of
the Feature Annotation Location Description Ontology
(FALDO).Bolleman et al.Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:39 Page 2 of 12
Although non-trivial, file format interconversion is a
common background task in current script-centric bioin-
formatics pipelines, often essential for combining tools
supporting different formats or format variants.
Like in the
kNN-based approach, the documents are processed using
the following techniques: segmentation into sentences,
tokenization, removal of stop words and normalization
using the Porter's stemming algorithm [23].Our experiments show that our kNN-based approach
is promising for biomedical documents classification in
the context of a large collection.These sys-
tems require therefore considerable resources in terms of
computation and storage compared to our kNN-based
approach.Our main contribution is to be able
to suggest relevant topics to any new document based
solely on portion of it thanks to a classification model
learnt from a large collection containing several hundreds
of thousands of previously annotated documents.Compared to existing kNN-based methods, our method uses classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for ranking
the labels.
Additionally, con-
sidering the plot in Fig.Hence,
functional coherence here is derived essentially from the
supporting literature, thus making the method sensitive to
Bastos et al.These functional annotations are associations of proteins (or other biological sequences) with descriptors
characterizing their biological roles.These sets were made by replacing the original proteins with increasing amounts (of 10% increments; 100 iterations) of random
proteins (taken from the CAZy database)
Bastos et al.It should be noted
that on the term-for-term approach the graph nature of
GO will lead to a statistical dependency issue.
Conclusion: Knowledge Author can support clinical domain content development for information extraction by
supporting semantic schema creation by domain experts.To improve
ease of use and support wide-spread adoption of the
Schema Ontology, a system which minimizes complexity
and allows simple interaction for users is needed.Within the clinical
domain, NLP systems have been implemented to support
pharmaco-vigilance, patient screening, patient narrative
summarization, and quality improvement [6–13].Semantic
modifiers vary depending on the semantic type
associated with the concept.In the clinical domain, creating a semantic schema typically requires input from both a domain expert, such as a
clinician, and an NLP expert who will represent clinical concepts created from the clinician’s domain expertise
into a computable format usable by an NLP system.
The
study extends the overview of all three tasks [32] and
organizers’ working notes on Task 2 [34, 57] by focus-
ing on Task 2 in significantly greater depth, focusing on
1) the difficulty of handling multiple short form senses,
and 2) the utility of each participating system with re-
spect to a vocabulary containing simplified health terms
for potentially supporting patient understanding of
clinical text.Methods
In this section, we describe the short form schema, data-
set, shared task, sense categorization, and short form
coverage using the Consumer Health Vocabulary.In terms of normalizing short forms with common
CUIs between the Consumer Health Vocabulary and the
ShARe test set, participant systems’ demonstrated mod-
erate to reasonable accuracy suggesting promising re-
sults for supporting patient understanding of clinical
text by replacing these concepts with a more lay term or
linking these terms to web resources.The ShARe/CLEF short
form test set consists of 860 unique terms and 706
unique Unified Medical Language System CUIs.With recent patient-centered initiatives, the focus of
the 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Challenge was to facilitate
development of natural language processing applications
that could be used to help patients understand the content
of a clinical report, and Task 2 focused on normalization
of short forms.
The CL is built according to the principles established
by the OBO Foundry [5] and is the designated candidate
ontology for metazoan cell types within the Foundry.In addition, subtypes of the class ‘cell in vitro’ have received improved definitions and labels to provide for
modularity with the representation of cells in the Cell Line Ontology and Reagent Ontology.The CL will continue to maintain general cell types for
representation of non-mammalian cells where no separ-
ate resource or ontology exists and will remain the prin-
cipal ontology for the representation of mammalian cell
types.Acknowledgements

Considerable ef-
forts have been invested to process and manually curate
huge amounts of data that is required to build such a
knowledge base around a specific indication.Although several disease models
exist, they often do not consider the quality of underlying data.We used SPARQL to traverse each of these knowledge
graphs (derived from distinct resources) in an integrative
manner, allowing highly disease specific analysis of the
underlying data.The importance of semantic
mining in the life science domain was brought to lime-
light by the Bio2RDF project [27], which demonstrated
the possibility of querying life science knowledgebases
by linking public bioinformatics databases and providing
public SPARQL endpoints.Prioritization of AD candidates
To illustrate the potential of NeuroRDF approach and to
determine novel AD candidates from the high quality
integrated data, we exploit the underlying biological
association between the different data resources and
identify the previously unknown information.
A delta is a set of operations on entities (nodes or
attributes, respectively) necessary to transform one
document into another [11].In our example, a
MismatchWithPublication caused an update of the
parameter value.Based
on the resulting set of annotations, differences can be
characterised and classified.The XML-encoded serialisation provides
the new and the old value of Km1:
<update>
<attribute id="1"
oldPath="/sbml[1]/../parameter[1]"
name="value" newValue="23.42"
oldValue="23.24" [...] />
</update>
Using COMODI the detected update can now be anno-
tated.More specifically, we started our investigation by man-
ually analysing a predefined set of cell cycle models2
from BioModels [12].
Hicks et al.For instance, the typologies of health care provider roles
and patient roles are relatively sparse compared to the
myriad of roles that a provider or patient might bear.For considerations of space and clarity,
we reserve a discussion of social identities for a future
manuscript.We distinguish the types of facilities based on their
functions
Health care provider roles
Wehave distinguished health care provider roles along the
lines of what kind of entity can bear that role.It is built
upon the Basic Formal Ontology and conforms to Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry’s best practices.
A similar argument is used by Verspoor et al.Dimitrova et al.More recently, Poveda-villalón et al.Meilicke
et al.Similarly, Serpeloni et al.
However, enabling automated reasoning over multiple
ontologies is a challenging task, since automated reason-
ing can be highly complex and costly in terms of time
and memory consumption [11].2Institute of Translational Medicine, University
Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, B15 2TT Birmingham, United
Kingdom.We have also identified a number of ontologies for
which performance of automated reasoning, at least when
using AberOWL and the ELK reasoner, is significantly
worse, which renders them particularly problematic for
applications that carry heavy parallel loads.Acknowledgements

Background
The science and practice of infectious disease epidemi-
ology, like climate science, is increasingly reliant on
computational simulation [1], which is performed by
software applications known as epidemic simulators.Journal of Biomedical Semantics  (2016) 7:50 Page 10 of 12
However, in other work, our OWL2 representation (i.e.,
Apollo-SV) supports reasoning in our ontology-based
catalog of infectious disease epidemiology (OBC.ide),
which is a catalog of datasets, publications, grey litera-
ture, and simulators [35].We validated Apollo-SV through use in
a simple end-user application that enables analysts to spe-
cify an infectious disease scenario and submit it to one or
more of six simulators.Apollo-SV is the product of an ontological analysis of the domain of infectious disease epidemiology, with particular
attention to the inputs and outputs of nine simulators.
In any case, to align
the LIMS and the institute’s activities, a deep under-
standing of the institute seems necessary, including its
reasons to exist and its strategies.Our goal in the rest of this paper is to expand the
DOLCE framework with new categories tuned to the mod-
eling issues elicited from scenarios like that of IZSVe.Nonetheless, the management of a large set
of laboratories and tests is quite complicated and in many
cases the LIMS is applied to the subset of data that are
homogeneous across laboratories and activities.A

poral status of an entity usually dependent on some social

Methods
OBCS development
OBCS is a community-based ontology of statistical tools
and methods used in biological and clinical investigations
that follows OBO Foundry principles in providing the pos-
sibility for enhanced representation and analysis of data
generated through complex statistical procedures.Overall, we believe that OBCS is a timely ontology able
to represent statistics-related terms and their relations in
a rigorous fashion, facilitate standard data analysis and
integration, and support reproducible biological and
clinical research.OBCS provides a timely source of statistical terms
and semantics in various areas of biological and clinical
statistics.OBCS provides a consensus-based rigorously
curated representation of the steps involved in statistics
pipelines in different domains in biological and clinical
fields, thereby supporting reproducibility of research.In this paper, we have
introduced Ontology of Biological and Clinical Statistics
(OBCS), focusing on the introduction of high level sta-
tistics terms in OBCS and on how OBCS can be used in
combination with OBI for the ontological representation
of statistics-related biological and clinical data process-
ing.
Scenario 6: diagnosis by non-human
The diagnostic decision support system has made a diag-
nosis (or misdiagnosis depending on whether it is correct),
because it (1) takes as input a clinical picture and repre-
sentations of the relevant disease type and one or more
types of phenotypes with which it is associated; (2) partici-
pates in a process of making a conclusion based on this
input; and (3) outputs from this process a statement about
a configuration involving an organism, a disease, and a
disease type.3 Misdiagnosis of type of disease.Scenario #5: layperson’s justifiable conclusion

Background
As administrative, clinical, and patient-reported data are
increasingly shared and reused, especially for patient
care [1–4] and research [1, 5–7], several issues with
these data—including diagnosis data—are of increasing
concern.2 Diagram of diagnostic process, its inputs, a correct diagnosis, its concretization, and the configuration that that the concretization is about

6 Comparison Between the Baseline and Pure EM Algorithm.It takes sev-
eral rounds (line 6), but behaves like the conventional
EM algorithm of alternatively applying the E and M steps
after the first five rounds (line 7).In this section, we
first describe these resources used in our event extraction
system and then develop graph representations, statistical
models and learning algorithms, in this order.Background
Current state-of-the-art approaches to biological event
extraction train statistical models in a supervised learn-
ing manner on annotated corpora, where event triggers, or
the expressions indicative of events, and event-argument
relations, or relations between events and their partici-
pant, are annotated (e.g., [1, 2]).The issues we have discussed so far are also relevant to
relations, but there are issues specific to events, includ-
ing the one that graphs with cycles and loops may lead
to an infinite number of event-taking events with distinct
event participants.
In this paper, we study the concept distribution of
SNOMEDCT’s sub-hierarchies, and we propose and eval-
uate an iterative algorithm for extracting balanced mod-
ules.The
dashed line represents the residual sum of squares of all sub-hierarchies, 0 meaning that the sub-hierarchies in the balanced module are distributed
in exactly the same way as in SNOMED CT (perfectly balanced module)

improved our ability to represent semantically problematic

that the Twitter messages in these alarms discuss real-

its effort in the development of ontologies and this is
likely to continue [1].The

The Bio-Ontologies meeting, as in years past, invited
presentation and discussion of research across a broad
scope, encompassing the organization and dissemination
of knowledge in biomedicine and any aspect of applica-
tion of ontologies in life sciences research.KV and AO were the Guest Editors
of the Thematic Issue and wrote the overview of the Thematic Issue papers.Summary of selected papers
In correspondence with the broad selection of topics rep-
resented at the Bio-Ontologies Special Interest Group
meeting, the papers selected for this special issue also
cover this range of topics.Introduction
This special issue originates from the papers presented
in a 2-day meeting, combining the Bio-Ontologies SIG
(Special Interest Group) meeting with a phenotype-
focused Phenotype Day, held at the Intelligent Systems
for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in Dublin,
Ireland in 2015.5St

It can also be treated as
a large collection of documents, as it contains over 2M
articles with at least 150 words each.Thanks to online resources, the access
to this literature seems easier and quicker than ever, but
often the sheer volume of potentially relevant articles
makes it extremely difficult for the end user.In addition, the meth-
ods were tested with different document collections,
which included PMC Open Access (PMC OA) and
Wikipedia articles.Recall in
our setting is defined as a ratio of the number of inputs
with a representation to the total number of distinct
items from a given dataset.We used [39] as a
practical guide to implement the statistical test.
