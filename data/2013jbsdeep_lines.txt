http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/6To evaluate this approach in practice, we selected
Alzheimer’s disease as a target domain, since represen-
tatives at the BioHackathon had already been involved in
developing AlzPathway [80,81] which collects signaling
and metabolic pathways relevant to this disease. A namespace for file formats would be useful -
candidates include the EDAM (EMBRACE Data and
Methods) ontology [108] and myGrid-Moby Web
service ontologies [109], which lists several of the
more popular formats (e.g., GenBank flatfile) and
could be extended with additional formats over time
(by the time of this writing, the myGrid-Moby data-
type ontology has been non-redundantly imported
into the appropriate portion of the EDAM ontology,
so this dichotomous choice no longer exists, and
EDAM should be considered canonical in preference
to the BioMOBY ontologies).The
full list of BioHackathon participants, and their respect-
ive projects, is available [24].and/or the dataset to which it belongs (spot informa-
tion from a particular microarray study, for example).The approach
of providing an object-oriented adaptor API on top of
SPARQL endpoints, which has a similar “look and feel” to
other OpenBio* project APIs, eases the transition to using
Semantic data.
Finally, in the

Furthermore, there are too many LFs for us to prepare a full
dictionary from scratch.Results: We built a Linked Open Data set that links LFs to DBpedia titles by applying key collision methods
(i.e., fingerprint and n-gram fingerprint) to their literals, which are simple approximate string-matching methods.Second, in the form of DBpedia [10], Wikipedia
is also used as a hub for the Linked Open Data (LOD)
cloud [11]; Allie users can access related information
that would otherwise be difficult to find by following a
series of links from an abbreviation-LF pair.More precisely, the relationship obtained based on
simple linear regression analysis is
log 1 yð Þ ¼ 0:2xþ 0:92;
where x is the frequency-based bin number of an LF and
y is the probability of its presence in DBpedia titles.Because the key
collision methods are known to be much faster than
other approximate string-matching methods, using them
is an effective way to build linked data, even for very
large datasets.
A notable feature is that Hydra often returns first
answers in quasi-real time, in minutes or even seconds,
which facilitates experimentation with different forms of
queries.The work of the Roundtable on Value and Science-Driven
Health Care of the US Institute of Medicine, and in par-
ticular their work on the Learning Healthcare System [6]
provides evidence of the need for such work.Infinite
time intervals can be specified by using infinities as their
ends.Time intervals in our model
are defined by specifying their ends as instants.However, note that Hydra is in its infancy and
its performance is expected to improve by several orders

The first missing is-a relation in the list has the
fewest possible repairing actions, and may therefore be
a good starting point.In Subsection ‘Repairing missing is-a
relations and mappings’ we try to improve this and find
more informative repairing actions.For 59 missing
is-a relations, the domain expert used the missing is-a
relation itself as the repairing action (i.e., the least infor-
mative repairing actions).For the wrong is-a relations under repair, the user can
choose, by clicking, multiple existing asserted is-a rela-
tions andmappings on the display as repairing actions and
click the Repair button.Using this algorithm structural repairs
are generated that include only contributing repairing
actions, and repairing actions of the form (a, t) or (s, b) for
missing is-a relation or mapping (a, b) do not introduce
non-validated equivalence relations (see pref1 and pref3 in
Subsection ‘Debugging workflow’).
With the ICD-11 contents loaded in the RDF

the facet f given the topic tk , and P(tk|wsj, f ) is estimated
with the joint probability of resource wsj and the task tk

The final similarity between a faceted query q and a
web resource wsj is given by the linear combination of the
probabilities of the facets in the query.As it is shown in this paper, BioUSeR addresses these
aspects by using both semantic annotations as a nor-
malization process consisting in the association of for-
mal knowledge to the available text descriptions, and
information extraction techniques in order to obtain
information about the facets from the annotated task

Machado et al.Machado et al.Additionally,
the GO was chosen instead of a clinical vocabulary since it has been extensively used
for annotation purposes, and thus possesses a background set of annotations that can be
promptly used, which is not normally the case for clinical vocabularies.Such datasets are frequently characterized by a small
number of clinical features and a high number of missing values, which difficults their
use for knowledge extraction purposes.We propose that the application of an enrichment
analysis to this type of dataset can result in the extraction of relevant knowledge from
controlled vocabularies to improve the quality of the dataset and, therefore, improve the
quality of the predictions made with it.In respect to the possibility of an insufficient level of detail,
it can be overcome by considering more than one vocabulary for the same domain of
knowledge, which we will do when analyzing the clinical features.

To start the formalisation of a specific kind of sci-

experimental results, the responsible community first
of all has to agree on the information needed.Summarising they state:
“[...] models fulfil a wide range of functions in building,
exploring and applying theories; in various
measurement activities; and in the design and
production of technologies for intervention in the
world.” ([5], p.24)
The set of ways how models can be used, provided by
Morrison and Morgan [5], is a good starting point for
an upper classification of general model use intentions.

Introduction
The integration of the biomedical literature into the
infrastructure of other biomedical data resources requires
the identification of entities and concepts, such as pro-
teins and gene named entities [1,2].Gene regulatory
processes
Rebholz-Schuhmann et al.A gene can be analysed by sequencing, but the observa-
tion of a protein and its functions requires more complex

There are several “standard” approaches to validate a

Analoguous to mismatches in MP (see section “Mis-
matches in EQ-lising MP”), mismatches in process enti-
ties were partially due to not supporting synonyms in

and “Mismatches in EQ-lising HPO”, for MP and HPO
respectively.Most of these mismatches can be resolved by augment-
ing the dictionary of the LingPipe FMA annotation server

information on synonyms and common names, and monophyletic supraspecific taxa that reflect our current
understanding of phylogenetic relationships.The VTO includes both extant and
extinct vertebrates and currently contains 106,947 taxonomic terms, 22 taxonomic ranks, 104,736 synonyms,Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2013, 4:34

Conclusions: The ontology-based data representation and integration using the FDA-approved information from
the vaccine package insert documents enables the identification of adverse events from vaccination in relation to
predefined parts of the population (age groups) and certain groups of vaccines.First, those vaccines that are associated with the largest
number of VAEs were analyzed (Table 2).One approach is to
link a vaccinee to a quality named ‘age’, and then link
the ‘age’ to a datatype using the OBI relation term ‘quality
measured as’.OAE defines an ‘adverse event’ as a
pathological bodily process that occurs after a medical
intervention (e.g., vaccination, drug administration).Secondly, the ontology OWL representation is also
interpretable by computers and software programs.
Jensen et al.The Open Biomedical
Ontology (OBO) Foundry promotes the development of
consistent formal ontologies based on a common upper-
level reference ontology to address this need [9].We have also imported over
700 classes from external ontologies, such as the Protein
Ontology (PR), Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA),
and Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) [15-17].ND is being developed in compliance with the Open
Biomedical Ontology Foundry principles and builds upon the paradigm established by the Ontology for General
Medical Science (OGMS) for the representation of entities in the domain of disease and medical practice.We have imported and utilize over 700 classes from related ontology efforts including the Foundational
Model of Anatomy, Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, and Protein Ontology.
This is crucial within the context of
community-level model reuse because, when repurpos-
ing a model, modelers must determine whether its
underlying assumptions preclude its use for a modeling

physical dependencies as a basis for biological
processes
Daniel L Cook1*, Maxwell L Neal3, Fred L Bookstein4 and John H Gennari2Abstract
Background: In prior work, we presented the Ontology of Physics for Biology (OPB) as a computational ontology
for use in the annotation and representations of biophysical knowledge encoded in repositories of physics-based
biosimulation models.Cook et al.Cook et al.Each

Thus, ENVO
was developed with the goal of interoperability with the
numerous biological and biomedical ontologies compli-
ant with Open Biomedical and Biological Ontologies
(OBO) Foundry principles [17,18] and is being aligned
to the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO 2.0 [19]; see below)
in aid of semantic homogeneity.Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2013, 4:43 Page 2 of 9
http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/43suitable for the annotation of any record that has an envir-
onmental component.ENVO is
comprised of classes (terms) referring to key environment-
types that may be used to facilitate the retrieval and inte-
gration of a broad range of biological data.For example,
when taken simply as the “surrounding space” of an
entity, the causal relevance of an environment to that
entity as well as its boundaries are unclear.Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2013, 4:43 Page 3 of 9

This situation necessitates careful tracking to en-
sure that all valid NDCs (and, indeed, any useful informa-
tion) associated with a retired RXCUI can be associated
with the most recent RXCUI that refers to the same entity.Results: We built DrOn in a modular fashion to facilitate simpler extension and development of the ontology and
to allow reasoning and construction to scale.DrOn contains a total of 514,268 classes as of this
writing.The dron-rxnorm module contains all of the informa-
tion mined from RxNorm, which at this point of the
ontology’s development, is the bulk of DrOn’s informa-
tion.As such, we
built our internal representation to maintain provenance
information of the sources separately, ensuring that we
can both track the provenance of the various entities as
the ontology develops and add new sources without ad-
versely affecting the existing ontology.
Principally, it improves the quality of linked data
in the Bio2RDF network and makes it easier to access or recreate the linked data
locally.Although there are several efforts for provisioning life science linked data such as
Neurocommons [10], LinkedLifeData [11], W3C HCLS [12], Chem2Bio2RDF [13] and
BioLOD [14], Bio2RDF is unique in several ways.The open-source Bio2RDF project [6-8] uses Semantic Web technologies and a set of
conventions to provide linked data [9] for the life sciences.Conclusions
Bio2RDF is an open source project to coordinate the provision of linked data for the
life sciences.Conclusions: This coordinated release marks an important milestone for the Bio2RDF
open source linked data framework.
Such biosimulation models represent
formal, physics-based expressions of one or more key biomedical hypotheses that are
of such interest as to warrant the difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone effort
required to encode, debug, and evaluate the model.How-
ever, to develop and refine their hypotheses, experimenters will need to be able to
dynamically combine and modify PhysioMaps.Such dependencies can obscured
by intervening variables and equations that may not have clear semantics.Figure 3a shows, on the left side, a PhysioMap representation of a
Figure 3 Prototype PhysioMaps as visualized by the Chalkboard system (Cook et al., 2007): (a) shows a
simple model of glycolysis and (b) shows blood flow processes in a cardiovascular (CV) model.Our vision is to develop multiscale/multidomain physiological pathway maps, pat-
terned after biochemical pathway maps, that represent the physiological content of bio-
logical models and datasets for use in large-scale physiological integration projects.
On top
of that, MeSH terms are used to automatically improve the recall of PubMed
searches through query expansion: By mapping keywords from a search query to
MeSH terms, relevant documents are included in the search results even if they only
contain synonyms or hyponyms of the original keyword.Conclusions
We investigated possibilities for giving patent searchers access to the same advantages
that are offered for PubMed through MeSH annotations.The document numbers were used to make sure that dif-
ferent versions of the same patent were not counted multiple times.These terms show multiple
aspects of the document, and their distance in MeSH is 14.The
first subsection explains our analyses of MeSH and IPC, and the following subsection
concerns our experiments with patent categorization.
Many of these annotations, especially for human,
are the product of manual and automated annotation by the Gene Ontology Annotation
(GOA) team at UniProt [2].We pro-
duced each term’s gene set by associating that year’s annotations to the terms in the
ontology.Results
Creating the Analytical Framework
Our framework consists of the following steps:
1 Identify term(s) of interest T. These may be representative terms of an area of interest
or a sample across the GO structure.The ever-increasing size of the human GO annotation dataset
(Figure 1) suggests that the structured representations of gene function are still very
much in flux.This process is among

annotation pairs from the start of 2002 through the start of 2012.
In our model, we follow the four principles proposed by Tim Berners-Lee for publishing
Linked Data [22]: (i) using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to identify things,
(ii) using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) URIs to enable things to be referenced
and looked up by software agents, (iii) representing things in RDF and providing a
SPARQL endpoint, and (iv) providing links to external URIs in order to facilitate knowl-
edge discovery.We expose our model, services, prototype, and datasets at http://biotea.idiginfo.org/
Conclusions: The semantic processing of biomedical literature presented in this paper
embeds documents within the Web of Data and facilitates the execution of concept-
based queries against the entire digital library.In our approach, existing ontologies are
brought together in order to facilitate the representation of sections in scientific literature
as well as the identification of biologically meaningful fragments.The
Biotea project comprises and makes available (i) a set of RDF files generated from the
open-access subset of PMC and enriched with semantic annotations, (ii) a Web Services
API for querying the RDF dataset, (iii) a SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language
(SPARQL) endpoint containing a subset of the RDF files as a proof of concept, (iv) an
article-centric prototype that acts as an interface to the WoD, and (v) an implemented
transformation process from our RDF files to Bio2RDF [18,19].PMC is a free full-text archive of biomedical literature; currently, it includes 1,679
journals.
Selection from hierarchical structure is also better suited for curation than selection
from a flat list of assays.The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB,
www.iedb.org) utilizes the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) and several
additional ontologies to represent immune epitope mapping experiments.Figure 1 Conversion of IEDB assay types from a static list to terms in OBI used to generate new search
interface utilizing a hierarchical tree.One
branch of OBI is its hierarchy of assays.With the term design accomplished and the QTT templates developed, the task of
migrating the hierarchical organization of assays in the ontology into IEDB and its
search interface was straightforward.
Despite the undoubted importance of probabilities in science it is unfortunately the
case that conventional knowledge representations in bio-medicine are insufficient to
support probabilistic reasoning.For example in 2001 Tissenbaum & Guarente showed that increased
dosage of the SIRT1 homolog extends lifespan in the nematode (Caenorhabditis ele-
gans) [22].To address this need we propose the ontology HELO (HypothEsis
and Law Ontology) that supports probabilistic reasoning about bio-medical research
statements.Adam then planned and executed cycles of aux-
otrophic experiments to test these hypotheses.There is therefore a need for a representa-
tion that focuses on the probabilistic features of research statements, and supports prob-
abilistic reasoning.

This article has been published as part of Journal of Biomedical Semantics Volume 4 Supplement 1, 2013: Proceedings
of the Bio-Ontologies Special Interest Group 2012.The authors discuss the long-term goal of enabling a true
semantic integration of data and knowledge in the biomedical domain.The authors demonstrate the utility of
HELO on three worked examples: changes in the probability of the hypothesis that sir-
tuins regulate human life span; changes in the probability of hypotheses about gene
functions in the S. cerevisiae aromatic amino acid pathway; and the use of active learning
in drug design, where a strategy for the selection of compounds with the highest prob-
ability of improving on the best known compound was used.soldatova@brunel.ac.uk

Abstract
Over the 15 years, the Bio-Ontologies SIG at ISMB has provided a forum for
discussion of the latest and most innovative research in the bio-ontologies
development, its applications to biomedicine and more generally the organisation,
presentation and dissemination of knowledge in biomedicine and the life sciences.PhysioMap and SemSim (semantic simulation) models are based on the Ontol-
ogy of Physics for Biology (OPB).
This overview will describe these classes of
applications, discuss a few examples of each type, and which NCBO Web services are
used by these applications.NCBO Technology overview

Ontology development and visualization
With the growing interest in the use of ontologies in the health care and life sciences,
additional tools are being developed to support the development of ontologies within
new biomedical domains and the re-use of existing ontologies to build application
ontologies.Whetzel and Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2013, 4(Suppl 1):S8
