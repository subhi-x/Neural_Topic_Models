3D anatomical model management
In biomedical education and research, 3D surface models
are useful and commonplace.The Alzheimer’s
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, [1]), Human
Connectome Project (HCP, [2]), NKI-Rockland Sample
[3], and others provide researchers with unprecedented
access to massive amounts of shared neuroimaging data.A
similar standardization issue faces the development of

In previous work,
we have outlined a Network of Relevant Ontologies for
Epidemiology (NERO) [13].Consequently, a new ontology that covers these specific
epidemiology concepts, while reusing and complementing
relevant existing ontologies in related domains is needed.EPO currently covers epidemiological and demo-
graphical parameters, for which there was very little cover-
age in surveyed ontologies, as well as transmission ofinfection, complementing classes from the TRANS ontol-
ogy.These data can then be used to fit the
parameters of their model.Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2014, 5:4 Page 3 of 7

Though
there were multiple specific activity groups under each
of the following headings, and there was overlap and
cross-talk between the activities of each group, we will
organize this review under the five general categories of:
RDF data, Ontology, Metadata, Platforms and Applica-
tions (Figure 1).The observations made, conclusions drawn, and software development projects that emerged from
these activities are discussed.Therefore, participants of the

The application of semantic technologies to the integration of biological data and the interoperability of
bioinformatics analysis and visualization tools has been the common theme of a series of annual BioHackathons
hosted in Japan for the past five years.
Indeed, among the sixty query terms for which the
expected synonym was not extracted, this was the case
in fourteen instances.Recall
is prioritized in this study and any decisions, such as
deciding which model parameters or which combina-
tion strategies are the most profitable, are solely based
on this measure.The best
combination finds only 10 of these reference synonyms
(exact match), which accounts for the low recall figures
in Table 10.corpus type (12 in total), the difference being the context
definition employed (1 + 1, 2 + 2, 4 + 4, 10 + 10).Post-processing rules are then con-
structed using the development subsets of the reference
standards and the outputs of the various semantic space

systematic way.Each of these has sub-
levels, out of which structure and property levels can be
further modified with attribute terms.In Figure 2 the distinction be-
tween terms of genetic and non-genetic origin is shown.The VariO annota-
tion is modular and therefore any number of terms can
be used, whatever is needed to capture the type and
effects of a variant.For example, quan-
tity terms are used to modify other terms when the ef-
fect is increased, decreased or is missing the quantity of
the parameter, or when it is not changed.
As a next step, we collect the labels in the form of text
segments located around the detected gel regions.Some attempts to classify biomedical
images include gel figures [21], which is, however, just the
first step in locating them and analyzing their labels and
their structure.In addition, we
extended this exclusion list with 22 general words that
are frequently used in the context of gel diagrams, some
of which coincide with gene names according to Entrez.f
Since gel electrophoresis is a method to analyze genes and
proteins, we would expect to find more such mentions in
gel labels than in other text segments of a figure.Thus, image mining builds upon the same gen-
eral stages as classical text mining, but with some subtle
yet important differences.We excluded tokens that have less than three characters,
are numbers (Arabic or Latin), or correspond to com-
mon short words (retrieved from a list of the 100 most
frequent words in biomedical articles).

We only display the number of rules for the ‘no cyclic’
mode because there are only six more rules in the DLV
programs with cyclicity-related definitions.Invoke DLV for decidability check.The main motivation for designing this syntax is to pro-
vide a means for creating ontological descriptions in a
more succinct way and without the use of special sym-
bols.Next we show the surface
syntax axioms that define the classes of carbon molecular
entities, polyatomic entities, carboxylic acids and esters.Examples of this type include carbon molecular enti-
ties, halogens, molecules that contain a benzene ring,
carboxylic acids, carboxylic esters, polyatomic entities,
amines, aldehydes and ketones.
• Between the clusters computed by the two methods
(semantic similarity and terminology structuring),
two clusters provided by these methods and which
have at least 80% overlap between them are also
merged together.These
figures also point out that there is a great variability across
the SMQs, while currently we use the same setting of the
methods independently from the SMQs.Finally, we perform two more steps to deduplicate and
merge the clusters:
• Separately for each method (semantic similarity and
terminology structuring), we compute whether
smaller clusters are included into larger clusters and
we merge those clusters which have at least 80%
overlap between them.The semantic distance
and merging approaches generate bigger clusters: they
lead to increased recall but they decrease the precision.For the setting of the thresholds
of the semantic distance and similarity algorithms and
their evaluation, we perform a ten-fold cross-validation:
the data are partitioned into ten subsets, one subset is
used for the setting up the methods while the remain-
ing nine subsets are used for the evaluation.
The sample size of human subjects
involved will also affect the statistical power of genetic
association studies.The Leiden Open (source) Variation Database
(LOVD) provides open data of genetic variants curated
from published paper, and the disease association in-
formation is included [56].Based on
this and many other case reports [34-36], we have gen-
erated the OGSF representation at the class level:
 ‘DRB1*15:01’ is subclass of (‘part of continuant at all
times that whole exists’ some (‘human vaccinee’ and
(inverse (‘vaccine immunization for host’) some
Pandemrix)))
 ‘DRB1*15:01’ is subclass of (‘material basis of at
some time’ some ‘genetic susceptibility to vaccine
adverse event’)
 ‘DRB1*15:01’ is subclass of ‘susceptibility allele’
This case study indicates that OGSF provides necessary
elements to represent genetic susceptibility and genetic sus-
ceptibility factors associated with vaccine adverse events.We have thus proposed to develop a single
ontology: the Ontology of Genetic Susceptibility Factors
(OGSF), to represent various types of genetic suscepti-
bility and genetic susceptibility factors supported by
textual conclusions given by genetic association studies.Discussion
In this paper, we have introduced the development of
the new version of the Ontology of Genetic Susceptibil-
ity Factors (OGSF) and its usage for ontologically repre-
senting genetic susceptibility to vaccine adverse events.
Then, we have declared in the form of RDF triples and
rules that will be explained as knowledge on how anatom-
ical entities are related by these two properties:
• The property mcf:PartOf is used to make explicit the
subparts of anatomical entities, which is an important
anatomical knowledge.RDFS is the schema language for
RDF.Similarly, we can make explicit the functions of
ensuring sliding motion of articular surface and
ensuring transmission and amortization of charges
Palombi et al.The interest of logical
rules (a la Datalog) is that they are easy to read and
write for practitioners and they have a polynomial data
complexity while allowing expressing complex interaction
between properties and recursivity.This complexity may explain the
gap between available anatomical ontologies and poten-
tial users [3].
Single-species model organism anatomy ontologies (ssAOs) have been established to represent this variation.Multi-species anatomy ontologies (msAOs; vertebrate skeletal, vertebrate homologous, teleost, amphibian AOs) have
been developed to represent ‘natural’ phenotypic variation across species.Our aim has been to integrate ssAOs and
msAOs for various purposes, including establishing links between phenotypic variation and candidate genes.Results: Previously, msAOs contained a mixture of unique and overlapping content.Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2014, 5:21

Intractable publication volumes; the difficulty of verifying evidence; and observed problems in evidence and
citation chains suggest a need for a web-friendly and machine-tractable model of scientific publications.They illustrate how and why
currently proposed “statement-based” approaches need
richer representation and how this model can play such
a role.Such a model must be capable of expressing a broad spectrum of representational complexity, ranging
from minimal to maximal forms.Such a common metadata representation of scientific
claims, argument, evidence and annotation in biomedi-
cine should serve as an integrating point for the original
publication, subsequent annotations, and all other com-
putational methods, supporting a single framework for
activities in the nine point cycle of authoring-publishing-
consumption-reuse we discuss in the section on Use
Cases.The micropublications model is adapted
to the Web, and designed for (a) representing the key ar-
guments and evidence in scientific articles, and (b) sup-
porting the “layering” of annotations and various useful
formalizations upon the full text paper.
Such onto-
logical definition allows the development and application of

Hardy et al.Furthermore, Thomas et al.Furthermore, conceptualizing and organizing this
knowledge domain in the form of an ontology allows
efficient augmentation of biological knowledge retrieval
and extraction.Recently, biomedical

in the ontology were annotated by additional informa-
tion including synonym(s), definition(s), and reference
(s).
However, it includes only 10 million triples.Wu et al.Wu et al.Wu et al.Wu et al.
In this core network, we investigate the distribu-
tion of the connectivity degree of different types of nodes.Figure 2 presents de-
tailed statistics on these network motifs.In this
network, nodes represent biomedical entities stored in
the RDF triples (i.e., diseases, drugs, or genes in “subject”
and “object”), and edges represent associations between
two biomedical entities (i.e., relationships in “predicate”).Based on the UMLS semantic
types and groups [16], we extract unique associations
among drugs, diseases, and genes, and represent them in
six views in relational database tables.For simplicity, we consider all associations as undirec-
tional association relationships in this study, discarding
the directionality and types in the original RDF graph.

Variation among anatomical phenotypes, whether across
species or between mutant and wildtype model organisms,
frequently involves changes in position and orientation of
structures.Particularly in light of the high level of conservation in
gene pathways underlying these axes across species (e.g.,
BMP gradients in dorsal-ventral patterning), the BSPO is
critical to enable interesting queries across phenotypes at
different anatomical positions.However,
even in this very simple plant, there are two AB axes, one
for the shoot system and one for the root.We
created the Biological Spatial Ontology (BSPO) to develop,
define, and standardize terms that can be used to describe
spatial and topological relationships, at multiple biological
scales from cells to whole organisms, and across diverse
taxa.

Emotion self-reporting
Mood or emotion monitoring via questionnaires and self-
reporting has been used in mental healthcare contexts,
and more recently mobile phones have been adopted to
serve that purpose [15].The use of free text to capture the name
of the emotion being experienced hinders subsequent har-
monization for research purposes of heterogeneous data
arising from different users.Various tools have been developed
that allow capture of emotional experience in the con-
text of specific application needs (e.g.However,
there has been no agreement on shared identifiers for the
underlying structure of the emotional domain such that
annotations could be compared between different tools
Hastings et al.For example, anger is an emotion defined in the EM as
“Anger is a negative emotion, characterised by feelings of
unpleasantness and high arousal, in the form of antago-
nistic feelings and action tendencies,” and fear is defined
as “An activated, aversive emotion that motivates attempts
to cope with events that provide threats to the survival
or well-being of organisms.
Although there are

The widely used Taxonomic Concept Trans-
fer Schema (TCS) [14] specifies the format (XML), in
which taxonomic information is presented when exchang-
ing data.Recognising taxa using identifiers
The most commonly used identifiers in biology are Life
Science Identifiers (LSID) [23].Taxon names are especially necessary when indexing
biological information and cataloguing biodiversity.Towards semantic handling of biological names
A biologist understands the semantics of scientific names
by reading scientific literature, but computers require
explicit identifier systems and data models to process
semantics.If two
or more taxa are lumped, the older name remains valid
but with a changed taxonomic circumscription, and the
more recent names become its synonyms.

Background: Phenex (http://phenex.phenoscape.org/) is a desktop application for semantically annotating the
phenotypic character matrix datasets common in evolutionary biology.
Therefore, approaches for ontology matching
have been proposed in the literature including cluster-
ing and blocking strategies (reduction of search space),
ML- based matching (in particular for reusing existing
alignments or combing results for parallel matches),
interactive alignment (taking into account the user) and
the use of specialised background knowledge (in particular
for the life sciences domain).In particular, we will
review approaches which use a space reduction strategy
for large scale ontology matching and machine learning-
(ML) based matching and briefly present systems evalu-
ated recently for the largest task in the context of the
international OAEI campaign.Keywords: Ontology matching, Life sciences ontologies, Entity similarity, Information retrieval, Machine learning,
Semantic interoperabilityIntroduction
With the wide adoption of Semantic Web technologies,
the increasing availability of knowledge-based applications
in the life sciences domain raises the issue of finding
possible mappings between the underlying knowledge
organisation systems (KOS).In the following section we will briefly give an over-
view of different approaches and systems in line with theapproach we propose in this paper.These challenges include effi-
ciency issues in term of space and time consumption,
the use of background knowledge, user involvement
and the automated evaluation of the matching system
[14,17].
The resulting file is written to the local filestore in
the same folder as the ontology file, with the naming
convention./<namespace>/<subject_predicate_object > .cfg.SPARQL query file
The third file generated by OpenLifeData2SADI contains
the SPARQL query that should be executed within the
business logic of the SADI Web service.For each Service, three configuration
files must be created:
Input and output ontology classes
Using the Java OWL API [19] we create ontology classes
based on the pattern of each SPO in each endpoint;
these classes describe the OWL properties required
for/provided by the Input and Output of the service
respectively.The SADI Galaxy plugin [27,28] provides SADI
Figure 2 Discovery and invocation of OpenLifeData2SADI services using the SADI plugin to the Sentient Knowledge Explorer. Executing the SPARQL query, extracted from the
configuration files, against the correct OpenLifeData
endpoint for that service, using each of the
incoming owl:Individuals to fill the query variables
for that particular invocation.Through our federated queries, we can
determine that these hgnc “Resources” represent, for
example, Genes, or SNPs, and thereby we are able to
construct semantically richer descriptions of what the
SADI services will consume/produce.
It
is important to mention that the query execution time
was measured when the first result was retrieved, i.e.,
we did not iterate over all results.T do //each BGP in query
2: for each ti ?Moreover, it requires the tumour number tumourNo,
which can be null and is obtained from the query as follow:
if a triple pattern with predicate tcga:bcr_patient_barcode
and bound object containing the patient barcode form a
star join with a triple pattern having predicate tcga:result,
then by using the patient barcode value specified in the
former triple pattern can be used to get the required
tumour number using TSS-to-Tumour hash table.This big data resource is designed
to be used as infrastructure for biomedical and bioinfor-
matics applications that analyse and query both the file
annotations but also the internal content of the patient-
derived files of this key reference for molecular biology
and epidemiology of cancer.Moreover, we can also obtain the tumour
number (to be used as input to Algorithm 1) from all of
the hybrid queries.
This is done by declaring a new class using a new
temporary identifier and adding the corresponding equiv-
alent class axioms.Non-templated class generation Biology and other
complex subjects cannot always be axiomatized in a tem-
platable way.We have experimented with multi-
ple reasoners and chose ELK [16] as the most convenient
compromise for TermGenie.Using the additional axioms from ChEBI and the GeneOntology,
a standard OWL reasoner can infer the more specific superclass ‘alkaloid catabolic process’ (GO:0009822).The class is defined by its genus ‘catabolic process’ (GO:0009045) and differentia ‘has_input camptothecin’
(CHEBI:27656).
The
first step in the annotation process involves identification

two modes: manual annotation mode and semi-automatic
annotation mode.For semi-automatic annotation, we have linked
Semantator with Natural Language Processing tools that

SEE is designed to enable the fabric of observations, methods,

ques.Accounts of evidence are directed towards the justification of scientific claims.Discussion
SEE design
SEE offers a tangible interpretation of the concept of evidence in terms of the argu-
mentative structure of the supporting background for a claim.Conclusions: SEE is suited to provide coherent and computationally accessible
representations of evidence-related information such as the materials, methods,
assumptions, reasoning and information sources used to establish a scientific finding
by adopting a consistently claim-based perspective on scientific results and their
evidence.There is, however, currently no
dedicated model supporting a coherent, extensible and semantic-web compatible repre-
sentation of all those aspects routinely considered by a researcher inspecting the
evidence for a given scientific finding, i.e.
These predefined
content types are packaged as Drupal features and available for use within eXframe.In addition several ontologies and vocabularies have
also been developed to describe biological specimens such as the organism, tissue, cell
type, disease state.Several repositories of genomics data have adopted the MIAME or MIBBI standards and
are leveraging these biomedical ontologies to provide consistent annotation of experi-
ments.However, surprisingly there has been no wide spread adoption of Semantic Web
technologies for experiment repositories, where queries using domain ontologies can
help bridge different disciplines, for important applications such as translational
medicine.20 July 2013

Abstract
Background: With the advent of inexpensive assay technologies, there has been an
unprecedented growth in genomics data as well as the number of databases in
which it is stored.
We used binary relevance in a single category to solve the multi label
classification problem.This article has been published as part of Journal of Biomedical Semantics Volume 5 Supplement 1, 2014: Proceedings
of the Bio-Ontologies Special Interest Group 2013.Of
course, this capture process will vary with the corpus to which it is applied, and a dif-
ferent corpus for the same ontology being modeled by the same gold standard will
produce a different reification of the dependencies captured in the form of annotations
across categories.The NCBO Annotator takes free text and uses efficient concept-recognition techni-
ques to suggest annotations from the Bio-Portal repository of ontologies [21].Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2014, 5(Suppl 1):S2

new ontologies.
We found that in addition to misleading phenotype alignments
between species, some disease categories are still more amenable to automated
predictions than others, and that this often ties in with community perceptions on
how well the organism works as model.Note that one
disease may fall into different categories due to multiple systems affected by disease.Note
that not all of Orphanet’s disease categories are represented due to the limited coverage in
our evaluation set of 28,516 known disease-causing mutations.Furthermore, the prediction results
depend on the organism and when automatically predicting disease gene candidates
careful consideration is required as to which organism to apply for the predictions.Conclusions: In conclusion, our automated disease gene candidate predictions are
highly dependent on the organism used for the predictions and the disease
category being studied.

tion, we incorporated terms from some of the Novartis ontology modules and terms

Background
Sequence annotations and their relationship with reference sequences
Sequence annotations are information artifacts that add biologically meaningful informa-
tion to specific locations on genomic, gene, transcript or protein sequences.The Human Genome project was com-
pleted in April 2003, followed by the release of human genome assembly NCBI35/hg17 in
May 2004.A Semantic Web approach to data integration
A possible approach to exposing sequence variation annotations in a computer accessible
format is provided by Sematic Web languages and tools [8].Disambiguation of
the variant description is an essential step in the context of data integration and
preservation.Data transformation to triples
As a preparative step, we first created annotation instances that closely matched our ori-
ginal data format.
